</div>

<p class='c005'>Not only is truth stranger than fiction, but it is
funnier also. Just as some men have no eye for
colors, but are color blind; so some men have no eye
for fun, but are fun blind. Happy is the man who
can see the humor which bubbles up in daily life;
doubly happy he who, having seen, can tell the fun
to others and so spread the glad contagion of a
laugh; but thrice happy is the man who, having seen,
can tell the fun; and having told, can picture it for
others’ eyes and so roll on the rollicking humor, for
the brightening of a world already far too sad.</p>

<p class='c006'>Palmer Cox is one who sees, and tells, and pictures
all the fun within his reach, as this volume of Frontier
Humor will certainly attest.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>NEW YEAR’S CALLERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Heigh ho, the New Year is again upon
us with its open houses, its “hope you’re
wells,” and its “bye bye’s.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Let what will grow dull or rusty, the sweeping
scythe of old Time is ever sharp and busy.
How tempered must be that blade which nothing
can dull or turn aside.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now as I sit by my window and look pensively
out upon the streets I see them crowded
with callers, all anxious to increase the number
of their acquaintances. They ring, scrape, and
wait. The door opens and they disappear from
my view, but fancy pictures them out as they
doubtless appear inside, embarrassed because
of a painful dearth of words. The weather,
fortunately, is a standing theme of conversation.
It will always bear comment, and but for this
how many callers—who perhaps can hardly
come under the head of acquaintances—would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wish themselves well out upon the street again,
even before sampling the customary wine and
cake.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Fashion is King, and when he nods, his
satellites and minions must obey or perish.
But I, who come not under the awe of his scepter,
have few calls to make. With a leaking
roof and no bolt to my door I can keep “open
house” without going to the expense of procuring
cake or wine, and for this left-handed
blessing may the Lord make me truly thankful.</p>

<p>STARTING OUT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have been sitting by my window most of the
day, watching gentlemen—who were not so fortunate
as myself. And I notice with considerable
pain—for as reader and writer cannot
understand each other too soon, I may as
well inform you at once that I am a philanthropist—that
some of these callers present
an aspect in the evening quite different from
their festive morning appearance. Here, for
instance, is a sketch of an exquisite as he
appears when starting to make his numerous
calls. Mark what grace is in every movement
as he struts the pavement with military
precision, adjusting his lavender-colored kids
as he goes. There is something in the airy
set of his stylish new stove-pipe, in the very
easy elegance of manner with which he holds
the crystal orb over his left optic, that
bespeaks the born gentleman. Not to a rise
in stocks, he would tell you, or a lucky lottery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>ticket, does he owe his carriage, but to a
line of ancestors which he can trace back,
perhaps, to the very loins of William the
Conqueror.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>A LITTLE MIXED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Look now upon <em>this</em> picture. The unpracticed
eye could hardly recognize the gentleman,
and yet this is the same sociable but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>absent-minded individual, as he appeared in the
evening frogging up the steps of the dwelling
opposite, to make his third call upon the same
family. He is evidently “turned around,” poor
fellow. Ah, this mixing of coffee, tea, and wine,
not to mention stronger potations, will play the
mischief with a man, and no mistake about it.
The young ladies, with mouths ajar and dilated
eyes, look out upon him through partially
closed blinds. But he recks not of it as he
leans backward, pulling and jerking at the bell
knob as though he was drawing on a tight boot.
The bell-hanger will doubtless have a job in
that house to-morrow. The question naturally
arises, will they chalk the gentleman down as a
caller each time he favors them with his presence?
Now that I think of it, they might do so
with an easy conscience, for he is certainly not
the man he was when he first offered the compliments
of the day.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SAM PATTERSON’S BALLOON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Last night while a party of us were sitting
around the table in the cabin of the <em>New
World</em>, talking about the “Avitor” and aerial
sailing generally, our conversation was interrupted
by a dark, raw-boned Hoosier who had
entered the cabin shortly after the steamer left
her wharf. He kept squirming on his chair for
some time, and was evidently anxious to take
part in the conversation. “I say, boys, I’m Sam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Patterson,” he commenced at last, “and if this
yer dish is free and no one han’t no objections,
I’d like mi’ty well to dip <em>my</em> spoon in.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SAM PATTERSON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>All turned to look at the speaker. Even the
fat old gentleman who during our conversation
had not taken his eyes from the <cite>Christian
Guardian</cite> he was reading, stretched up and
peered over the top of the paper at Sam. Before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>any one could reply the Hoosier gave his chair
a hitch nigher the table and went on:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I say, boss,” he continued, addressing his
conversation to me, perhaps because I had just
been expressing my opinion, “I don’t go a
picayune on navigatin’ the air. They ain’t no
need of talkin’ and gassin’ about crossin’ the
’tlantic or any of them foolish ventur’s. I happen
to know somethin’ about balloonin’, and understand
pooty near what you <em>can</em> do and what you
<em>can’t</em> do with one of them fellers. I’d a plag’y
sight ruther undertake to cross the ocean in a
dug-out, than ventur’ in one of them tricky cobwebs;
you can’t depend on ’em. Thar like
a flea—when a man thinks he’s got ’em he
hain’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps you are misled by prejudice?” I
ventured to remark.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I ain’t nuther,” answered the Hoosier,
“I speak from experience. I’ve bin thar.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! you have given the aeronautic science
some attention then?” I said. “An inventor,
I presume?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wal, no. I don’t exactly claim to be an
inventor,” he replied; “I reckon I foller’d on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the old plan, exceptin’ in the material used in
constructin’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you ever make an ascension?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wal, yes, I’ve bin up <em>some</em>,” he answered
dryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you ever been very high?” inquired
the fat old gentleman, who seemed to grow
interested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps not so high as eagles or turkey-buzzards
fly, but a mi’ty sight higher than barn-yard
fowls ventur’,” answered the Hoosier.
“You see,” he continued, “I was stayin’ down
to Orleans once for about a week, and thar was
a professor had a balloon in the park hitched to
a stake, and he was histin’ people up the length
of the rope for two bits a head. I stepped into
the cradle that was a hangin’ to it, and went up
the length of the rope, and liked it pooty well.
I went up three or four times and made considerable
inquiries about the manner of constructin’
and inflatin’, as I was cal’latin to rig up one when
I got hum to Tuckersville.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I got back I telled Sal what I was
bent on doin’. She tried pooty hard to git the
notion out of my head, but t’was stuck thar, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>a bur to a cow’s tail. I telled her it mout be the
makin’ of us, so arter a while she gin in, and as
silk was too alfired expensive Sal gin me a lot
of bed sheets and helped me sew ’em together
down in the cellar. We put it together down
thar ’cause I didn’t want any of the neighbors to
know what was up, until I could astonish ’em
some fine mornin’ by risin’ above the hull
caboodle, and for wunst lookin’ down on some
on ’em that was snuffin’ around and tryin’ to
look down on me mi’ty bad.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I used a rousin’ great corn basket for the
cradle, and arter she was all ready for inflatin’
I had my life insured, ’cause I didn’t want Sal
to suffer by any of my ventur’s. Then I went
to Sol Spence, the lawyer, and had him draw
up the writin’s of a will, and while he was doin’
it he worked the balloon secret out of me, and
wanted me to take him along. I telled him
’twas pooty risky business, and that he’d hev to
run some chances, as I was cal’latin’ on seein’
what clouds war made of before I came down.
He said them war his sentiments exactly; that he
allers had a great hankerin’ to git up thar and
see what sort of a spongy thing they war, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“I didn’t object much; I reckoned the sheets
war good for it, though he went over two hundred,
but I cal’lated he’d do instead of ballast,
and be company besides. So I took some bed
cord and slung another corn basket below the
one I was gwine in, and after dark we hauled
the great floppy thing out into the back yard,
and arter we got it histed up on stakes we
commenced buildin’ fires under her to git the
gas up and gittin’ things ready ginnerally.
About sun-up we had her all ready to step into.
Spence had his sketch book along, cal’latin’ on
taking some bird’s-eye views, and I had a bottle
of tea, cal’latin’ to empty it gwine up, and fill
it with rain water while up thar. The thing
was a-wallopin’ and rollin’ around the yard
mi’ty impatient to git off. I hitched her first to
the grindstone frame, but she was snakin’ that
around the yard, and the dogs commenced
sech an all-fired yelpin’ and scuddin’ round
and watchin’ of it through the fence, that we
were obliged to put ’em in the cellar, ’cause we
didn’t want the hull neighborhood attractid by
ther barkin’. Then we fastened the balloon to
the shed post, and left Sal to watch her while
we war eatin’ a snack of breakfast. Pooty
soon arter we heard Sal a-shoutin’ that she
was a-gwine off with the wood-shed. So we
ran out mi’ty lively, and had no time to spare,
nuther. I jumped up and caught one rope,
and Spence got hold of another. We couldn’t
fetch it down till Sal caught hold of my leg,
and between us three we pulled it back agin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“She gin a sort of puff and come down
pooty sudden when near the ground, and one
of the posts of the shed came fair onto the
back of a leetle pet hog that was rootin’ round
the yard, and knuckled his back down into the
chips, leavin’ his head and hinder parts stickin’
up. He commenced sich an uproarious
squealin’ you could hear him more’n two
miles. While Spence and I were fussin’ at the
ropes to unloose her from the shed, she took
another sudden start up agin and shot away
from us quicker than scat. Sal happened to
have hold of a rope at the time, and up she
went into the air, scootin’ like a rocket. Sal
was a plucky critter. Shoot me, if she wasn’t
as full of grit as a sandstone. She could have
let go that rope, but she wouldn’t; she wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to fetch the consarn down agin, and was bound
to cling to her until she did. Blow me, if I
didn’t think for a while I was goin’ to lose the
old woman. Thar she was a-hangin’ on to the
end of the rope, hollerin’ like a hull regiment
chargin’ a battery, and trailin’ and swingin’
about without any notion of lettin’ go.</p>

<p>ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION OF SAM’S WIFE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“We had a lively time of it gettin’ her down
agin too, now I can tell you. I jumped over a
fence into the garden, and snatchin’ up a rake
commenced to scrape at her, and finally the
teeth caught in her dress, and then I had a
pooty good hold so long as Sal was good for it.
Spence got hold of another rope that was danglin’
around, so between us we got her down the
second time. Then I sung out to Spence,
‘Spence,’ ses I, ‘climb into yer basket and let’s
be off, or the hull town will be here and stop us
gwine.’ So we clim’ into our baskets and flung
out Sal’s flatirons, that we had for ballast, and
up we shot like a spark up a chimney. I hollered
back to Sal to put the hog out of pain
and stop the squeakin’, and the last I seed of
her as we went round the gable, she was a
whackin’ him over the head with the back of an
ax, and he was a hollerin’ wuss and wuss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The wind took the balloon over a swamp
back of the village, where no person seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>see us, and then the world began to drop away
pooty nicely. ’Twant long till I heered Spence
callin’ out, mi’ty skeered like:—</p>

<p>“LET ME GIT OUT!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“‘I guess, Sam, you mout as well land her
and let me git out.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Are you afeered, Spence?’ ses I, jest that
way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No,’ he answered. ‘I arn’t afeered, but I
reckon my fam’ly would be mi’ty uneasy about
this time if they knowed whar I was, and I begin
to feel pooty sowlicitous about ’em.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘This yer thing is somethin’ like law,’ I ses,
‘when yer’ into her you’ve got to keep goin’ till
somethin’ gins out. She hasn’t got a rope a
holdin’ of her down now, Spence, and as for
yer’ fam’ly, I reckon the’re a mi’ty sight safer
than you be, so if you have any spare sowlicitude,
you had better be a tuckin’ it onto yourself.
‘Sides,’ I contin’ed, ‘I hain’t studied into
the lettin’ down part of it half so much as into
the rizin’.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Jerusalem!’ he shouted. ‘I thought you
war famil’ar with the hull thing or I’d have as
soon thought of gwine up in a whirlwind.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I fancy I do know considerable about it,’
I ses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then why can’t you stop her right here?’
he hollered, lookin’ up, pooty pale.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“‘I cal’late we’ve got to keep ascendin’ while
the gas holds out,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Thunder and lightnin’!’ he hollered, jest
that way, ‘and what are you agwine to do arter
the gas gins out?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I reckon,’ ses I, ‘we’ll come down agin.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘A flukin’?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Perhaps so,’ ses I. ‘I cal’late we’ll come
down faster than we’re gwine up, but I’m hopin’
to catch an undercurrent of a’r that will sweep
us along, and let us down sort of gently.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as we war talkin’ somethin’ gin a
whoppin’ crack overhead, and she began to
drop down by the run pooty lively.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What’s that?’ shouted Spence. ‘I think
I hear a sort of tearin’ noise up thar; ain’t
somethin’ ginnin’ out?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I reckon the old woman’s sheets have commenced
to gin out,’ I said, kind of careless like,
though beginnin’ to feel mi’ty narvous all to
wunst. On lookin’ down, I seed Spence was a
cranin’ out of the basket and lookin’ down, jest
as pale as could be.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Sufferin’ pilgrims!’ he shouted. ‘Can’t
you throw out somethin’, Sam, and lighten her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>a leetle? She’s droppin’ straight down, like an
aerolite.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I hain’t got anythin’ to throw out exceptin’
the tea bottle, and that ar’ is e’enmost empty,’
I ses. ‘I cal’late we’ve got to take our chances;
if you hain’t forgot yer childhood prayers, you
mout as well be a runnin’ of ’em over, for
things are beginnin’ to look mi’ty skeery jest
now, I can tell ye.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pooty soon I heer’d him a mumblin’ to himself,
and I allers allowed he was prayin.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“We war now about steeple high, and as I
had expected, the wind caught us and began to
sweep us around pooty loose. As we went
wallopin’ over St. Patrick’s church, Spence’s
basket struck the spire and was a spillin’ of
him out like a lobster out of a market basket.
I peered over and seed he was e’enmost gone,
so I hollered, ‘Go for the spire, Spence, it’s
your only chance.’ He seemed to be of the
same mind, for as I spoke he was a grabbin’ for
it and managed to git hold of one end of the
weather-vane. I reckon if he had got hold on
both ends he’d ha’ bin all right; but things
war gettin’ desperate and he had to take what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>come. The balloon riz some when he fell out,
and as it was a movin’ off I looked back to see
how he was a makin’ it. He was a hangin’ thar
like a gymnast, a kickin’ and a wormin’ and the
steeple a rockin’. But he was too awful heavy;
he couldn’t draw himself up nohow. Pooty
soon the tail of the fish gin out, and down he
slid along the steeple like a shot coon down a
’simmon tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fortunately he struck the roof and over it
he rolled, clawin’ and a scratchin’ the shingles
as he went. But it was ‘all go and no whoa,’
as the boy said when he was a slidin’ the
greased banister. Old Father McGillop was
just comin’ out of the vestry door after matins
as Spence come a scootin’ over the eaves and
down kerflumix right on top of him. This, ye
see, sort of broke the fall for Spence, but it
spread the distress. He was so heavy and
come with such force he disjinted the neck of
his Riverence, and shoved it so far down into
the body that his ears were restin’ on the shoulders.
They had to git a shovel to dig him out
of the ground, and Doc Willoughby was a
fussin’ over him more than five hours, a yankin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>his neck out of his body, and pressin’ his ears
into shape, and”——</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop now,” said the fat old chap, who was
worked up to the top notch of attention, “do
you mean to say he lived after his neck was dislocated?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wal, I reckon, boss,” said the narrator,
as he took a fresh quid of tobacco, “I hain’t
made no sech unreasonable assertion. I was
sayin’ they hauled his neck back, and put his
ears in place agin (or ruther one of ’em, for the
butcher’s dog eat t’other one before the old
sexton could git to it), so that he mout make
somethin’ like a decent appearance in the coffin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Soon as Spence went over the eave I lost
sight of him, for I was drivin’ pooty briskly
over Kent’s corn patch, and as I came sweepin’
down by the widder O’Donnell’s she was in the
yard gittin’ an apron full of chips. I reckon
she heer’d a burrin’ sound overhead, ’cause she
looked up, and when she seed the balloon she
gin a squall and cried out somethin’ about protection.
I reckoned she was callin’ on the
saints, but had no time just then to listen.
Before she had gone many steps she dropped,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and I allowed she had gone down in a faintin’
fit.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was a drivin’ and a driftin’ over the village
like a thistle-down, for more than two hours,
and the dogs war a barkin’ and the men and
wimmin a hollerin’ and a runnin’ arter it wherever
it drifted. The barn-yard fowls war a cacklin’
and a screamin’. Jewillikens! didn’t I make a
rumption among them though! You’d think
thar war forty thousand hawks and turkey-buzzards
a hoverin’ over the village, by the way
they scattered, aginst the winders, ahind stun
walls, into the wells, under lumber piles and
currint bushes; such a scrougin’ and squattin’
and scootin’ I never did see. Parson Jones had
thirteen lights of glass smashed by fowls batterin’
aginst the winders tryin’ to git in, and
Dud Davis, the blacksmith, fished seven dead
hens, two turkeys, a guinea fowl, and two small
pigs out of his well next day, whar they sought
refuge and war drown’d. Dad Kent gin me six
traces of good seed corn next fall. He said
barrin’ the killin’ of Priest McGillop, it was the
best thing that ever happened in Tuckersville.
He said I did more for his crop than if he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a scarecrow standin’ astride every hill. Thar
wasn’t a crow flew within two miles of the village
for mor’n a fortnight, and by that time the corn
was grown so they couldn’t pull it up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pooty soon the balloon come down about
house high and druv over toward the dee-pot.
I was a hopin’ she’d catch on the telegraph wire,
but she skimm’d over, like a swallow over a
fence, and immediately riz up tree high agin,
where scrape, slap, slash, she went into an ole
pine that stood out alone in the field. I was
scratched pooty bad, but hung on to the limbs,
and arter a while slid down the tree leavin’ the
balloon hangin’ in the tree-top. Great turnips!
if all Tuckersville wasn’t down thar in five minutes.
Thar war young ‘uns runnin’ around half-dressed,
with corn-dodgers in their hands, and
wimmin with babies in their arms. It was like
a dog fight, only, as the feller said when describin’
the nigger by the mulatter, it was more so.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The train was delayed half an hour that
mornin’, ’cause the engineer, conductor and all
hands jumped off the cars and ran down to the
balloon. Peg-leg Dibbly, the Mexican war
veteran, was thar, hobblin’ around among the
rest. He was in such a hurry to git down to
the tree he wouldn’t go around by the road,
but started in to take a short cut across the
marsh with the crowd. And he had a sweet,
sweatin’ time of it too, now I can assure you.
First his cane would stick, and just about the
time he would git that out, down would slide his
iron-shod leg fully a foot into the mud, and stake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>him thar like a scarecrow. Then he would look
down to where the people were standin’, and
jerk and swear until the want of breath only
would make him let up. He got down thar
after a while though, but he had to crawl considerable
before he could do it; and arter he got
thar he was bobbin’ here and bobbin’ thar, tryin’
to git a better look up into the tree, until at last
he stumbled and fell across one of Dud Davis’
young ‘uns, and gin her left leg a compound
fractur’. She set up a screamin’, and he was so
weak and frightened he couldn’t git up agin no
how, but lay thar gruntin’, and sprawlin’, and
kickin’ his one leg around. The blacksmith was
thar himself, and when he seed his young ’un
down in the mud with her leg broke, you never
seed a man so mad in all your born days. He
jest ran and grabbed the old pensioner by the
coat collar, and slung him mor’n fifteen feet,
landin’ him slidin’ on his back in the mud, like a
crawfish.</p>

<p class='c006'>“About the same time Tubbs, the cooper, was
a lookin’ up, and he seed a bough springin’ up,
and he allowed the balloon was comin’ down;
so he started to run, and stepped on the foot of
Kent’s snappin’ bull-dog, that was a settin’ thar
lookin’ up the tree, thinkin’ thar must be a coon
up it. The cur whirled round mad, and set his
teeth into the nighest thing to him, which happened
to be old Polly Alien’s ankle. But he got
more than he bargained for, though, for she was
so tuff that his teeth stuck thar, and she was a
screamin’ and a runnin’ hum, draggin’ him arter
her mor’n half the way. I never did see sich an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>excitin’ time. School was dismissed, and there
wasn’t a lick of work done in Tuckersville the
hul day. The hul talk was ‘Sam Patterson’s
balloon, Sam Patterson’s balloon.’ I didn’t have
to pay a picayune for anything for mor’n three
weeks. Parson Jones preached a tellin’ sermon
about the balloon, and thar wasn’t standin’ room
in the church; they had to keep the windows
open and let people standin’ on the outside stick
their heads in and listen. He likened it first to
youth, when it was a rollin’ around in the back
yard, whar nobody seed it, impatient and ambitious
to rise. Then like unto manhood, when it
was up, a bustin’ and droppin’ down agin. Next
he said it resembled old age, when it was in rags
a floppin’ around in the tree, more for observation
than use. Thar wasn’t hardly a dry eye in
the hul meetin’ house. Hard-hearted old sinners
cried like teethin’ babies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The balloon hung in the tree all summer,
and every day thar’d be a crowd of people
starin’ at it, like cats at a bird cage. A photographer
came the hul way from town, and
took lots of views of the remains; and one of
Frank Leslie’s special artists come rattlin’ down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>thar, and sot on a stun wall for two days drawin’
sketches of it. He said it was the most
spirited subject he had sot eyes on since he
sketched the hoop-skirt Jeff Davis was captured
in. But I’m gettin’ ruther dry. Ain’t
some of you fellers agwine to call on the stimilints?”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>That blabbing Hoosier, Bob Browser, has
found me out, and paid me a call, boring
me with his confounded stories. Even as a
hungry parrot when crackers are in view, or
as a miller’s hopper when water is high and the
farmer’s meal bags low, he rattles right along
with copious discourse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s that you say! Did you know Jim
Dudley? What! him as the boys in Gosport
used to call Carrot Top Jim? Wal, I’ll be rattled
if that ain’t queer. Wasn’t he the allfiredest
shirk you ever did see? Perhaps you
remember how sudden he left Gosport jest before
the war? Oh, that’s so, sure enough, you
went north sometime afore that.</p>

<p>BOB BROWSER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Wal, that chap was etarnally gettin’ in some
scrape or another; I do jest think I’ve helped
that Jim out of more close corners than there
are buildin’s in this yer town. Yer see him and
me was great chums, and roomed at the same
house on York Street. Jim was a courtin’ a
butcher’s darter that lived out near the cem’t’ry
for ‘bout a year afore he left, leastwise he was
a totin’ of her around considerable, takin’ her
to picnics, circuses, hoss races, and the like. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>kind of had my doubts about him gettin’ married,
’cause he was a pooty sot ole batch’, and
sometimes I’d ask him when the nuptils were
a comin’ off; but he’d allers shuffle out of it by
sayin’ when they did come I’d git an invite, and
kind of larf it off jest that way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One night pooty soon arter I had got into bed
I heered some one thumpin’ at my door, and afore
I had time to say anythin’ Jim Dudley was plum
across the room and standin’ by the bedside.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Bob,’ ses he, jest that way, ‘we’ve got to
part agin’ and I’ve come to gin your paw a
shake afore I leave.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What’s up now, Jim?’ ses I, pooty surprised
and settin’ up amazin’ fast in bed to strike
a light, ’cause I allers liked Jim. Drat my pictur,
if I didn’t. He stuck to me like a hoss-leech
when I was down with the yaller fever. I
was peeled down so mi’ty thin that I didn’t make
a shadder only arter I’d been eatin’ corn-dodgers
or somethin’ that wasn’t transparent. Soon
as I got a light I seed his face was tombstun
white exceptin’ some long red scratches onto it,
that made me think thar had been cats a-clawin’
of him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“‘I haint time to gin perticulars now, but
water’s gettin’ too plaguey shaller for me in
Gosport,’ ses he, jest that way. ‘And I’m gwine
to pull out for deeper soundin’s. I want to
head off the night express, and as I’ve got only
fifteen minutes to do it in, must be a movin’,’
and givin’ my hand a rattlin’ shake he turned,
and before I could say ‘scat,’ he was goin’ down
the stairs like a bucket fallin’ down a well, and I
thought he hadn’t more than got to the middle of
the flight when I heer’d the door slam behind him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I lay awake thar for hours thinkin’ and wonderin’
what on airth could have turned up to
make Jim dust out of town so all-fired sudden,
bein’ as how he was doin’ pooty well pecun’ar’ly—that
is, for <em>him</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I kind of mistrusted somethin’ had gone
wrong with him out to old Hurley’s—the butcher’s.
So the next day, bein’ kind of curious, I
took a stroll out that way, to look around a
leetle and see what was goin’ on. I seed a
glaz’er a fussin’ round a winder, and old Hurley
sittin’ on the steps lookin’ mi’ty solemn at a hat—which
I knowed was Jim’s—that was a-hangin’
on a bush in the garden.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Some months arter this the war was a bilin’
and I jined a company and went down to Cairo
to go into camp. By jingo! would you believe
it? almost the first man I ran ag’in’ was Jim
Dudley! He’d enlisted in a hoss regiment up
to St. Louis, and come down to camp a few
days afore me. We were both mi’ty tickled to
meet one another right thar, so we p’inted for a
place where we could have a straight-out chat,
and while we were sittin’ thar, talkin’ about old
times, ses I to him:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Jim, now we’re a gwine down into this
blamed muss, and the chances are pooty good
for us to git chawed up down thar, and nothin’
more to be heer’d about us—now s’posin’ you
tell a feller what made you pull up stakes and
dust from Gosport so amazin’ fast, last Fall.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, Bob,’ ses he, ‘seein’ we’ve met agin,
I don’t mind if I do ‘lighten you a leetle in regard
to my leavin’ so sudden. You remember
I’d bin over to Franklin some time afore I left,
and jest got back to Gosport that day, and in
the evenin’ I started out to see Mag. I was a
hopin’ the old man wouldn’t be to hum—he ginerally
was away Saturday nights.</p>

bats were a flitterin’ aroun’ the gables and
apple trees, a-lookin’ for thar suppers. I gin the
bell-knob a jerk anyhow, and pooty soon old
Hurley hisself came to the door, with a candle
in his hand. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and
I reckon he had jest come hum from work. He
kind of gin a start, as though he was surprised
to see me; and I gin a start, too, and jumped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>back from the door pooty quick, for I thought I

enjoyin’ good health. I hope you’ve come prepared
to stop with us awhile.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thankin’ him for his kind wishes, I follered
him along, wonderin’ what in time made him so
amazin’ solicitous for my health all to wunst,
’cause I knowed the old man hated me worse
than a rat does pizen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He didn’t stop in the parlor where some
folks were sittin’, but kept on into a small room,
beck’nin’ me to foller, which I did, though I was
beginnin’ to feel pooty suspicious about the old
feller’s movements.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Stay here a minute, Mr. Dudley,’ ses he,
arter I had sot down. ‘Make yourself comfortable
until I come back agin,’ he continued,
jest that way, and then he stepped out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you, I begun to feel wonderful fidgity
and kind of prickly down along the spine; and
when I heer’d the old man comin’ back, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>heer’d his feet slappin’ down heavier and faster
than when he went out, then I knowed thar’
was trouble ahead. I could feel a distressin’
presentiment jest a-bubblin’ through my veins,
and limberin’ up all my jints.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pooty soon the old man came in, a-holdin’
his left hand in front of him doubled up tight
as though for boxin’, and keepin’ his right hand
ahind him, kind of careless like, as though ’twas
there by accident. I knowed ’twas no nat’ral
position, and kept peerin’ round, for I ’spected
he had a cow-hide, and was calculatin’ to gin
me a sound tannin’; but when he went to shet
the door ahind him, I got a glimpse of the
alfiredest great butcher’s cleaver you ever yet
sot eyes on, a-shinin’ jest as bright as could be.
Jerusalem! if that bone-splitter didn’t make
me begin to feel tarnation uneasy, then thar’s
no use sayin’ it. My heart flopped up so far
into my throat it actewelly seemed as though I
could taste it.</p>

<p>OLD HURLEY ON THE WAR PATH.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The old man gin one rattlin’ shout like a
wounded gorrillar, when he seed me go. I
knowed he’d be arter me mi’ty quick, so I broke
through the gardin for the toll-road, the blarsted
ole sash a-hangin’ around my neck like a hog-yoke,
catchin’ on everythin’ as I ran. I hadn’t
more’n struck the road and begun to dust along
it, when I heered the old man comin’, a-snortin’
an’ a spatterin’, down the turnpike ahind me.
I ‘lowed he’d overhaul me if I kept right on,
’cause I hadn’t got the sash off yet, and the
blamed thing was jest ginnin’ my neck jess;
so flouncin’ aside pooty sudden, I flopped
down ahind a sassafras bush, and I hadn’t
more’n got thar nuther when old Hurley went
a-rackin’ and a rearin’ past, the bloodthirsty
great meat-ax a-gleamin’ in his hand. He
reckoned I was still ahead, so he went a-flukin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>down the road, clearin’ the toll-bar at one
bounce, without so much as dustin’ it, and
keepin’ right on for Gosport. Thunder! didn’t
I tear off the ruins of that winder mity fast,
though? Then I clim’ the fence, and took
across lots through Hiram Nye’s corn patch,
and down by Blake’s orchard, comin’ into town
by the lower road. I think more’n likely old
Hurley kept a-goin’ it plum to Gosport before
he mistrusted that I dodged him; and I do jest
think if he had got hold on me—a-bilin’ as he
was—he wouldn’t have left a piece of me together
large enough to bait a mink trap.
Wasn’t that an all-fired close dodge, though?
I reckon you’ll not see me in Gosport agin,
leastways not while old Hurley’s a-livin’. I’ve
no notion o’ gettin’ married in no such haste as
that. Thar’s the bugle callin’ to muster—let’s
hurry up and go.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A CUNNING DODGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>There was a certain citizen of this place, a
butcher by occupation, who, deeming the
remuneration he received small in comparison
to the amount of service done, resolved to discontinue
butchering cattle and become a butcher
of men, or in other words to assume the responsibilities
of a practicing physician and surgeon.
It seems in his travels he had collected quite a
number of receipts and prescriptions from old
almanacs and doctors’ books.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this limited stock of medical knowledge,
and an unusually large amount of “cheek,” he
thought to work himself into a lucrative business.
As an invoice of smallpox was expected
by every steamer, he imagined he might pass
among other professionals as though his scientific
acquirements were excelled by none, and
his vocabulary of Latin names surpassed “Doctor
Hornbook’s.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Hiring an office in a central locality, he
hoisted a board reaching nearly across the
building, on which his name and calling were
made known in large characters. Then sitting
down amidst a “beggarly account of empty bottles,”
he patiently awaited the result. Whether
the city had suddenly become remarkably
healthy through the sanitary exertions of the
health commissioners, or he had not his proportionate
share of the medical practice in
requisition, he knew not, but certain it was, that
from morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve he
sat in his room—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As idle as a painted ship</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon a painted ocean.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One day, however, while straying along North
Beach, musing on the strange vicissitudes in
human affairs, and thinking how “weary, stale,
flat and unprofitable” were all the uses of this
world, a happy idea presented itself. In the
vicinity of the County Hospital he had noticed
the invalids coming out to sun themselves, like
seals, along the Beach. What a glorious attraction
to custom they would be, congregated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>around his door! Entering into conversation
with some of them, he soon struck a bargain
with thirty or more. They were to visit his
office once a day, those who could walk there
without much trouble or pain receiving fifty
cents per day, while those who traveled under
greater difficulties were to be paid accordingly.
So, every morning, after breakfast, they took up
their line of march in twos and threes along the
street toward the charlatan’s place of business.
They were indeed a motley crowd—that cripple
brigade—as they hobbled through the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>ADVANCE OF THE CRIPPLE BRIGADE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>There came the maimed, the halt, the withered,
and the blind, shuffling into his office
thicker than diseased Jews to the troubled pool
of Bethesda. If any stranger chanced to drop
in for medical treatment, the crowd of hired
specimens began at once to converse among
themselves of the wonderful skill of the physician.
One remarked how his sight had improved
under treatment, how he could see two
objects now where he used to see but one.
Another related in glowing terms the ravenous
appetite the doctor’s bitters had awakened in
his system; through all the hours of the day he
was now as hungry as a whirlpool. A third
would eulogize his method of treating contagious
diseases in general.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this way the real patient, though receiving
no actual benefit from the watery potions administered,
was retained in hopes of an ultimate
cure. At length the curiosity of the resident
physician of the Hospital was aroused. He
couldn’t imagine where his patients filed away
to every morning, as regularly as liberated geese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to some well-known pond. Following up the
bandaged crew and investigating the matter, he
soon learned the state of affairs, and forbade
their leaving the Hospital yard without a permit.
This sudden falling off in the would-be-doctor’s
patients made a material change in the appearance
of his office. In short, it leveled his business
and his hopes, and again the quack sank
into that obscurity from which he so energetically
struggled to emerge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A TERRIBLE TAKE IN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>To-day, while taking dinner in an eating-house
in a Western town, I witnessed an
amusing incident. It appears the proprietor
had often been imposed upon by bummers who
would walk boldly into the dining-room, and
after stowing away a supply of victuals that
would fill an ordinary carpet sack, would shuffle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>up to the counter, and in an undertone of voice
inform the person there officiating that they
were unfortunately “dead broke.” Of course
the law doesn’t allow any ripping to be done on
such occasions, other than swearing. Then the
well-filled rascals would walk off picking their
teeth with the utmost composure; except in
extreme cases when the out-going party would
be assisted over the threshold by an uprising
boot. But even kicks would not bring the coin
into the till, or bring back upon the table the
vanished edibles, so this treatment was seldom
resorted to. Finally, the proprietor bought a
large syringe, and placing it in a drawer in the
dining-room, bided his time.</p>

<p class='c006'>It happened while I was sitting at the table
an individual, whose cheek the proprietor had
reason to believe far exceeded his checks,
entered the room and sat down directly in front
of me. A plate of hot bean soup sat invitingly
before him, from which the savory steam rose
up in clouds, and not only filled the nostrils of
the hungry man with delicious and enticing
odors, but served to whet the hungry edge of
appetite.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
<img src='images/p075.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“PAY IN ADVANCE, SIR.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lifting a large pewter spoon that lay beside
the plate, he was about to introduce it to the
hot decoction before him. Already the limber
hinges of his jaw began to relax, preparatory to
admitting the well-filled spoon. His attention
was suddenly arrested by the proprietor, who,
with one hand behind him and the other laid
upon the spoon-arm of the would-be eater,
demanded the price of the dinner before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>went any further. The man, it seems, was not
a member of that class of individuals which the
hotel keeper thought him. He was justly indignant,
therefore, at the demand, and sharply
informed mine host that “he guessed after he
had eaten his dinner would be time enough to
pay for it.” But the oft-swindled proprietor
thought differently. The man had scarcely got
the words out of his mouth before “mine host”
produced a syringe, large as the trunk of a
small-sized elephant, and slapping the nozzle of
it into the soup, ran it circling around the plate,
and with one long, slobbering draught, like that
of a horse drinking through his bits, the soup
plate was left lying before the hungry man, as
empty as his own stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>The astonished individual looked first at his
plate, on which not even a bean was left, then
at the dripping, steaming muzzle of the syringe,
and lastly at the landlord, who stood with a
look of triumph spreading over his face, silently
waiting for the man to either come down with
the coin or leave the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though not liking that summary way of
treating a person, the man was either too hungry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>or too limited in time to go further for a
meal, so he fished out of his pocket the change
and handed it to the proprietor. The latter
thereupon discharged the contents of the
syringe into the soup plate again, and walked
away, leaving the customer to proceed with his
dinner.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE ROD OF CORRECTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>It is not often that a poor fellow like myself
can have a good laugh at the expense of a
high dignitary. To-day, however, an opportunity
presented itself, and happily I was in the
right humor to appreciate it. Passing along a
narrow street, I saw an old Irish woman unmercifully
beating her boy with a rod, which, if
it had not been divested of twigs and leaves,
would have served as a Christmas tree for a
good-sized family. This of itself was nothing to
make one smile, and perhaps no person would
more readily endorse such a sentiment than the
boy himself. But the end was not yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears that while on his way from the
grocery, with a pitcher of beer for his mother,
the little fellow tripped-up and spilled nearly the
whole contents in the street. This was something
that Temperance folk might well rejoice
over, but it was a serious matter for the boy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The old woman, with parched lips was standing
at the gate, impatiently awaiting her youngster’s
return. She saw him emerge from the store,
pitcher in hand. Her quick eye caught sight of
the light foam rising in airy bubbles above the
brim, and she knew the grocer had sent her no
stinted measure. In fancy she was already
quenching her thirst with copious draughts of
the cooling drink—when she saw the boy measuring
his length upon the planks. Worst, and
most lamentable of all, she saw the delectable
beverage coursing down the sidewalk in a dozen
foaming streams. Her rage knew no bounds.
The moment the boy put his foot inside the gate,
she seized him with the grip of a virago, and
belabored him with the cudgel till he roared. So
great was the outcry that every window in the
vicinity was immediately crammed with heads.
Taught by the lessons of my youth that he who
meddles in other people’s affairs often treads
upon his own corns, I maintained a wise silence;
but I mentally prayed that the wrath of the old
fury would be appeased, for the cries and wild
antics of the little wretch began to grow monotonous.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>A REAR ATTACK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There chanced at that moment to be passing
an eminent minister who weekly fills his fashionable,
spacious church with a glittering congregation.
He saw the woman was in a
towering passion, and he ventured to remark:
“My good woman, the rod of correction should
never become the weapon of passion.” The
remark, which seemed good and to the point,
caused her temporarily to suspend hostilities;
but she still retained her hold on the collar, as
she turned around sharply to ascertain who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>dared criticise her method of training up a
child in the way he should go.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a minute she glared upon the clergyman
with flashing eyes, as if astonished at his interference.
Surveying him from the soles of his
boots to the very crown swirl of his silk hat,
she drew herself up to her full height, and, in
the most indignant voice, shouted: “Away wid
yer cotations, you ould sermon thief! It’s not
from the likes of yees I learn me juty!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The clergyman was nonplussed; he quailed
before the fiery eyes and sarcastic tongue of
the old vixen; and I fancied his face lit up with
joy when he discovered that he was nigh a
corner, around which he quickly disappeared.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ST. PATRICK’S DAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Erin go bragh! St. Patrick’s day is upon
us, and the city seems wrapped in a
“mantle of green,” so numerous are the Irish
flags flying in the breeze.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'>Alike, the harp and sun-burst flies!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ear of morn is stunned with the bray of
at least a dozen blatant bands, as they discourse
Old Erin’s soul-stirring airs. It is an easy matter
for a person to imagine himself sitting by some
sheeling door in “County Kerry” instead of
this great American city by the sea. The
Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Fenians
are out in full force, with clean-boiled shirts
and soap-washed faces. Marshals charge
around upon their caparisoned steeds like real
heroes, and sitting gracefully as a sack of
potatoes upon the back of a spavined mule
trotting over a corduroy road. Evidently some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of them have never before bent over anything
that came nigher to an equine than a saw-horse.
It is plain</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Those who always rode, now ride the more,</div>
      <div class='line'>And those now ride who never rode before.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Well, they love the country that gave them
birth, and that is a virtue that is certainly commendable,—a
natural excellence often wanting
in other nationalities. Besides, celebrating the
old gentleman’s birthday makes business lively
with the stable men and the shoemakers, and
that of itself is a good reason why the demonstration
should be encouraged. It is hardly
probable that any of the great powers will be
materially weakened by these loyal manifestations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a sketch of a spirited member of the
“Ancient Order of Hibernians,” as he appeared
passing my window in the morning, full of life
and loyalty, tripping the asphaltum pavement
lightly as though traversing the springy surface
of his native bogs. And following is another
sketch of the same individual in the evening,
when full of oaths and whiskey, lying in the
gutter with all that ease and abandon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>characterizes the Celtic race, wherever dispersed,
in every land and in every age.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>IN THE MORNING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The different races of men have their different
weaknesses. It may seem an extravagant statement,
but I venture to say if there had been no
rice plant in the world, the Chinese would not
have cared to live. I will even go further and
say perhaps there would have been no Mongolian
race. And now the thought occurs to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>me, this deficiency in the human family would
not have been such a terrible thing after all.
True, we should have been obliged to get
along with catnip tea instead of Souchong,
which would have been pretty heavy on old
women. We also would have been obliged to
worry through without old Confucius, which
might have made some confusion in metaphysics
or political morality. But as the latter
could hardly be worse than it is at present with
all his teachings, we possibly might have managed
to exist very well without the moon-eyed
philosopher.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p094.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>IN THE EVENING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The Teuton dotes on his well-seasoned
bologna. The grizzly Emperor William I,
standing upon an eminence near Rezonville,
overlooking the battle-field, with a spy-glass in
one hand and a large bologna sausage in the
other, furnished indeed a striking sketch for the
special artist of the occasion. The humor of
the situation came in when the Emperor, forgetting
himself in the excitement of the moment,
raised the sausage to his eye instead of the
spy-glass, and because he failed to see the
squadron of Uhlans—that a moment before
were charging upon a battery—concluded they
were blown to smithereens, and losing his
usual equanimity, commenced to swear fearfully,
and order up another division to take
their place. There was a broad and sarcastic
humor couched in the remark of the officer at
his side, who observed the mistake, and ventured
the suggestion, “If your Majesty will take
another bite from the sausage, perhaps you
will be able to see through it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And then, there is the jovial, careless, free-hearted,
yet quarrelsome Irishman, who thinks
a new Jerusalem without a little whiskey still in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>one corner of it,—“over beyant the throne, and
forninst the back dure,” for instance—would be
just no Paradise at all. I believe there is not a
race of men on the face of the earth—from
Behring Straits to Terra del Fuego, round and
about, over and under, or down either quarter—that
can extract the same genuine soul-satisfying
bliss from a flattened nose or swelled lip,
that a real, irrepressible, County Kerry Irishman
can. Let him have that, and a good stiff horn
of whiskey to keep the blood running freely, and
my advice to you is, keep upon the other side
of the street, if you intend to sit for your picture
that afternoon, or visit your sweetheart that
evening, or expect to take up the collection
during divine worship the next Sunday. At
such a time he is no respecter of persons, this
set-up Irishman.</p>

<p class='c006'>You may be the Rector of the finest cathedral
in the place, the mayor of the city, the judge of
the supreme court, or even the governor of the
state, and should your hat chance to blow off
and roll in front of him,—though it should cost
him a fall upon the pavement,—that man will
kick it. I tell you he will kick it, and soundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>too. He will make no mincing about it, but go
for it, as he would for his neighbor’s pig, should
he find it in his garden of cabbages. At such
he is full of words also, and can bestow upon
the stone that trips him up the same flow of
abuse that he can shower upon the man who
assists him to his feet.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ALL FOOLS’ DAY.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>This is “all fools’ day,” and judging by the
number of people who are passing along
the sidewalk with strings and rags dangling
from their coat tails, the custom of making
people appear ridiculous is not obsolete. What
delight the youngsters take in covering a few
bricks with an old hat, and leaving it temptingly
upon the sidewalk, while they withdraw
into some nook to watch the bait and halloo at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the person who is thoughtless enough to kick
it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SOLD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Though the custom has age to sanction it, I
am decidedly opposed to making people—either
on the first of April or upon any other
day—appear ridiculous in their own eyes as
well as in the eyes of every person with whom
they come in contact. People will make fools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of themselves often enough, without the assistance
of others. I wonder why men are not
more upon their guard upon this day. Just
now I saw a newspaper reporter, who certainly
should have known better, kick an old hat from
his way, and go limping to the office, denouncing
everybody in general, but children in particular.
Speaking of reporters calls to mind
something that I have often thought. I believe
if I had been endowed with more cheek and
less scruples about over-stepping the line of
veracity, I long before this would have made
my mark in the world as a newspaper scribbler.</p>

<p class='c006'>My unconquerable modesty always rose up
like a barrier between me and reportorial fame.
It would never allow me to dip into trivial,
baseless rumors, and magnify them into scandalous
reports. My pride, too, was a clog that
blocked the wheel of progress. I could never
throw it aside long enough to intrude myself
uninvited at select gatherings, or creep and
crouch under a window-sill or behind a door,
like a base eavesdropper, to hear words that
were not intended for the public ear, in order
to work up a stirring article. But for these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>drawbacks, I cannot help thinking I would have
done well at the business, because, by a singular
decree of fate, I am generally present whenever
any strange or amusing incident transpires,
or even when scenes of a serious nature furnish
work for the pen, and many a time, too, when
I could well wish myself suddenly removed far
enough from the distressing scene before me.</p>

<p class='c006'>This afternoon, for example, a terrible assault
was perpetrated in the back yard of the house
adjoining the one in which I reside.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no use talking, I will have to get up
and bundle out of this locality, before long. It
is becoming too rough a quarter for me. Its
poisonous air would tarnish the brightest reputation
that ever shone upon a forehead.</p>

<p class='c006'>With my usual luck, I happened to witness
the affair. Thus far I have kept it to myself, as
I have no desire to figure in a court of justice
in any such scrape. Some people, perhaps,
would rush forward and volunteer their testimony,
but I am not of that turn of mind, and
calculate to keep my mouth shut until it is pried
open by a legal bar. I have been looking over
the evening papers, but they make no mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the case, so perhaps the authorities are keeping
the matter quiet, fearing that by giving it
publicity they would defeat the ends of justice.
With this thought in mind, and to help them
along in their efforts, it being “all fools’ day,”
also, I will say no more about it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>FINDING A HORSE-SHOE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Upon this day, and at this time, while the
fire burneth in the grate and the warm
drink steameth in the bowl, I speak as with the
tongue of a scribe of the olden time, and this
is the burden of my speech:—</p>

<p class='c006'>A certain man, a citizen of this place, as he
journeyed to his home, that looketh toward the
mountain which is called Lone—and at the base
of which the dead are entombed—found an
horse-shoe in the way. And he was exceeding
pleased because of his luck, insomuch that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>rubbed his hands together joyfully, and said
within himself: “How blessed am I in finding
this shoe in the way. This bodeth good to me
and mine household, because it pointeth in the
way that I am going, and it would show a lack
of understanding in me should I not pick it up.”
So he placed it carefully in the pouch that was
sewed in the hind part of his garment, which is
called the tail, and hastened on towards his
home; and as he went his countenance was
bright to look upon. And it came to pass when
he had arrived at his house, and was entered in
at the door, he said unto himself—for he was
an eccentric man, and his ways were not as the
ways of sensible people—“Now will I make all
haste and fasten this shoe above my parlor
door, that it may continually bring good towards
my house, for my grandmother hath often said
there lieth a charm for good in the horse-shoe
that is picked up by the way.” So reaching
forth his hand, he took a hammer and a nail—such
a nail as builders use when they would
have their work outlast themselves—and stepping
upon a chair, essayed to transfix the shoe
to the casing above the door.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
<img src='images/p109.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE HORSE-SHOE CHARM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now it chanced that this man had a wife, a
woman who was not eccentric, neither had she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>patience to spare on those people who had eccentric
ways; and as she was at work in the
kitchen—for upon the whole sea-coast there
was not found a more industrious or tidy woman—she
heard the sound of the hammer proceeding
from the room which was her pride; and
she made haste and dropped the dough that she
was kneading for the oven, and looking out into
the apartment, she beheld her husband standing
upon the chair attempting to transfix the horse-shoe
above the door. And she was exceeding
displeased because of his action, and of his provoking
eccentricity, and she remonstrated with
him mildly, saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Souls of the Innocents! is this a barn? or a
blacksmith’s shop? or are ye gone stark, staring
mad? or has old age benumbed your senses
beyond all hope? that thus you would establish
the unsightly object above the door, to be a jest
for visitors and a shame unto us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the good man of the house, looking
down reprovingly from the eminence upon
which he was now set up—being nettled because
she had likened him to a man stark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>staring mad—answered the woman sharply,
after this manner, saying:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go delve into thy dough, <em>old</em> woman! Did
ye never have a grandmother? or is thy memory
as short as thy wind? Know ye not I fix it
here that it may bring good unto our house, as
hath been said of it in the olden time?” So
he left off speaking with his wife, but turned
him about and once more essayed to establish
the shoe above the door. For his mind was
firm on that point, that he would nail it there,
that it might bring good unto his house.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then waxed the woman exceedingly wroth—for
she was of the house of O’Donohue,
whose temper caused him to be cast into prison,
because he smote the anointed priest within the
chapel—and bending her body, she laid hold of
the rounds of the chair upon which her husband
was builded up, and pulled it suddenly from
beneath him while he did reach to drive the
spike, and behold, he came down quickly, and
lay along the floor like a cedar felled.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it so happened, as the woman attempted
to pass out by the door which led out into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>kitchen, lo! a hammer followed after, and overtook
the woman, and lodged upon her back,
even between the two shoulder blades, and
caused her to cry out with a marvelous loud
cry; but turning herself around while yet the
cry was proceeding from her mouth, she lifted
the hammer from the floor and cast it from her,
even at the countenance of her rising husband.
Now it came to pass when the good man of the
house looked upon the weapon as it left the
hand of his wife, and saw that it was drawing
nigh unto his head, swift as a javelin hurled
from a Trojan’s arm, he said within himself,
“As my name is Bartholomew, my hour is
come.” And as he spoke he dived to the floor,
that it might pass over and work him no harm.
But even while he stooped, the weapon caught
upon his scalp and peeled it backward to the
very nape.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then went the woman out into the kitchen,
and when her husband was risen from the floor,
he ran out into the streets seeking where he
might find a surgeon; and as he ran the people
stood and looked after, and communed one
with another, saying: “Surely this man hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>escaped from the Modocs!” But he was
sorely troubled because of his scalp, so he
heeded not the people, neither loitered he by
the way to enlighten them concerning the
wound; but when he had entered in at a surgeon’s
door he entreated him to make all haste
and bind up his wounds, that he might become
whole again.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p113.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>REPAIRS NEEDED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>And when the surgeon drew nigh and looked
upon the wound he was exceedingly astonished,
and he cried, “Of what tribe was the
savage that hath done this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the injured man answered him sorrowfully,
saying, “Nay, but my wife hath done this
thing!” and bowing his head between his knees
he wept bitterly, even as David wept when he
learned that Absalom had perished in the
boughs of the great oak. And when the surgeon
had poured oil upon the wound, and
sewed it together—even as a housewife seweth
the rent in a garment—and spread plasters
upon his head in divers ways, he arose and
journeyed to the Hall of Justice, which is by
the Plaza, and entered a complaint against the
woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it came to pass when the magistrates
and the wise men of the place heard his complaint,
they looked upon him as a person
altogether given over to falsehoods, and they
questioned him, saying: “How may we know
if ye indeed speak the truth in our ears.” And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>removing the bandage from his head, with which
the surgeon had wrapped it round, he answered
and spake unto them, saying: “Ye ask for
proof, and behold! I give it you!” And when
they drew nigh and looked upon his head they
saw that it was covered over with plasters, insomuch
that it resembled a bolt of linen fresh
from the loom, and they were sore displeased
because of the assault. So they called together
four men, the chosen officers of the force, and
commanded them to arrest the woman, saying:
“Take ye the woman into custody, and lodge
her in prison, that on the morrow we may sit
in judgment over her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So these four officers, named Murry, the
brave; and Flynn, styled the “blinker,” and
Curran, and Flaherty,—surnamed the “beat”—armed
themselves with pistols, and clubs, and
knives, and went forth to arrest the woman.
And a great crowd followed after, for they said
among themselves, “Surely some murder hath
been done.” So when they had come nigh to
the house they laid plans how they might surround
it; and this was the manner of their
approach toward the house. Murry on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>east side; and Flynn, styled the “blinker,” on
the west side; and Curran on the north side;
and Flaherty, surnamed the “beat” on the
south side. So they did compass the house
about and enter it; and this was the manner
of their entrance. One by the front door, and
one by the back door, and one by the window
that looked out at the west side of the house,
and one by the window that looked out at the
east side of the house; and they did converge
and meet in the centre. And they found the
hammer and the blood thereon; and the horse-shoe
and the nail sticking therein; but they
found not the woman. And they searched the
house, beginning at the cellar, and ascending
even up to the loft, but be it known unto you,
the woman had fled, and her whereabouts
remaineth a secret to this day.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>AN EVENING WITH SCIENTISTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>This evening I accepted an invitation from
a member of the Academy of Science to
attend a regular meeting. I started out almost
under protest, thinking it would prove a very
dry entertainment. It had been said that at
their meetings they conversed only about fossils
or strata, or grew warm while arguing some
point about the Azoic or Silurian age, that
period before the Dinotherium or even the
Mastodon ran bellowing across the flinty earth.
I was agreeably disappointed, however. For
I found it not only instructive, but amusing
to others than scientists. The President announced
to the Academy that a feathered
mouse had been sent by an unknown friend
from a distant town. A vote of thanks was
then tendered the donor. The feathered mouse,
however, proved to be a cruel fraud, for a subsequent
examination revealed the painful fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>that the feathers were stuck to the skin by some
adhesive substance. The vote of thanks was
then rescinded, and the feathered mouse was
informally introduced to the office cat.</p>

<p class='c006'>A communication was then read from a man in
the interior. He informed the Academy that he
had in his possession a large sow, which, when
quite a small pig, had been severely bitten by a
black dog, which made a lasting impression upon
her. In after years if any of her litter were black
she singled them out, and devoured them with
as little remorse as an old woman would a dish
of stir-about. The sow had that day died from
the effects of eating a tarantula, and he offered
to donate her to the Academy, providing they
would bear the cost of transporting her to the
city. By a unanimous vote the communication
was laid <em>under</em> the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quite a discussion then took place as to
whether pigs really do see the wind, and if so,
why?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
<img src='images/p119.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A member then presented the Academy with
a new species of snail, or slug, which he found
in the mountains, and which had but one horn.
He proposed having it called a “unicorn snail.”
Quite a controversy followed. Several members
maintained that the snail imprudently left
its horns out over night, and one, getting nipped
by the frost, dropped off. This proposition
angered the generous donor, and reaching forth
a hand trembling with emotion, he lifted the
snail from the palm of the admiring President,
and laid it down gently upon the floor—as a
mother might deposit an infant in the cradle—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>while the Academy stood spell-bound, before
a tongue could be loosened from the roof of a
mouth, or a hand stretched to save, he planted
the sole of a number eleven boot upon the
crowning back of the little gasteropod, and
when he lifted his foot again, all that was visible
of the one-horned snail was a little grease spot
upon the floor, the size of an average rain drop.
This inhuman act seemed to throw a gloom over
the Academy.</p>

<p class='c006'>No further business appearing, the meeting
adjourned.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>AN OLD WOMAN IN PERIL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Yesterday, while in the back country, I
saw an old woman in what would have
been a very laughable predicament, had it not
been a very pitiable one.</p>

<p class='c006'>An unusually large vulture had for some
time been soaring in the neighborhood, occasionally
scraping acquaintance with one of the
fat ewes grazing in the valley. Several of the
farmers had felt the vexation of seeing him
perched upon a lofty eminence and making the
wool fly from some favorite Cotswold. They
were justly enraged, and resolved to put a stop
to his depredations.</p>

<p class='c006'>They accordingly posted themselves nigh
their flocks, and with guns heavily charged,
awaited the advent of the rapacious bird. But
he was no booby, and though his gizzard could
digest a good-sized rib or hoof with all the ease
of a Ballyshannon woman making away with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>mealy potato, yet he hadn’t the least inclination
to test its grinding power upon a charge of
slugs or buckshot.</p>

<p class='c006'>For several days thereafter he was known
in the neighborhood as a “high flier.” With a
pining maw he would sit upon some heaven-kissing
crag, and with drooping head watch the
fleecy flocks grazing in the green valley below.
He found it difficult, however, to cloy the hungry
edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast,
and, emboldened by want, began to drop to a
lower level when flying across the fields.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yesterday, as mutton was out of the question,
he resolved to try his beak upon some
tougher viand, and while in the vicinity of the
village, he swooped down upon a little old
woman who was gathering chips in front of
her cottage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor old body had not the least warning
of the vulture’s approach. As she stooped in
the act of picking fuel enough to cook her
evening meal he dropped upon her like an
arrow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
<img src='images/p124.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE OLD LADY’S ASCENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fastening his powerful talons in the strong
material of her loose-fitting garments, he spread
abroad his mighty wings and began to haul her
heavenward. The astonishment, anxiety and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>indescribable antics of the poor old lady when
she found herself slowly but surely leaving
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span></i> by an unknown agency were indeed
terrible to witness.</p>

<p class='c006'>She knew not whether it was a gold-tinseled
angel, or an iron-rusted demon, that was thus,
in open day, and while she was yet in the flesh,
unceremoniously translating her to some remote
planet; she had no means of discovering;
she was only certain she was going—that
her direction was onward and upward.
Her favorite hollyhock tickled her nose as she
swept over her little garden, and the clothes-line,
that for a moment seemed to baffle the
vulture’s flight, was now stretching beneath.</p>

<p class='c006'>She deployed her feet, regardless of appearances,
first to the right, then to the left, above
and below, vainly endeavoring to come in contact
with something that would give her an inkling
of what was responsible for this mysterious
movement. There was a vague uncertainty
about the whole proceeding well calculated to
alarm her. Even though she succeeded in
shaking herself loose, her fall would now be
fearful, and each moment was adding to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>danger. What could I do? I was powerless to
save. I had no gun, and even if I had there
would have been some grave doubts in my
mind as to the propriety of firing, as I generally
shoot low, and such an error in my aim could
hardly have proved otherwise than disastrous.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no use striving to make the bird
loosen his hold by hooting. If there had been
any virtue in that sort of demonstration the old
woman would hardly have been raised above
the eaves of her shanty, for she was screaming
in a manner that would have made a Modoc
blush. The only thing that suggested itself,
and that rather hurriedly, was to get out my
pencil and paper and take a sketch as she appeared
passing over her cottage in the vulture’s
talons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The blood, which at first forsook her cheeks
through fear, was almost instantly forced back
into her visage again by the pendant position of
her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>She beat the empty tin pan which she still
retained in her hand, but the voracious and
hunger-pinched vulture had no notion of relinquishing
his hold on account of noise. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>contrary, he seemed to enjoy it, and with many
a sturdy twitch and flap, and many an airy
wheel, he still held his way toward a rugged
promontory situated at the head of the valley.
Fortunately, when he was twenty feet from the
ground and about eighty rods from the cottage,
the calico dress and undergarments in which
mainly his talons were fastened, gave out, and
the liberated woman dropped on hands and
knees in the muddy bed of the creek, over which
the bird was passing at the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>While hovering over her, about to pounce
down upon her and try the elevating business
again, a sheep-herder who had seen the bird approaching
the cottage, gave him a dose of buckshot,
which broke one wing and left him at the
mercy of his captor.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>This afternoon I attended a private wedding
on Howard Street. I may safely term it
“marriage in high life,” as the combined height
of the couple was something over twelve feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The groom was a bachelor, who for many a
year had stood around the fire like the half of
a tongs, very good as a poker, but not worth
standing room as a picker up.</p>

<p class='c006'>He looked as though it wouldn’t require
much advice to make him—even at the eleventh
hour—prove recreant to his vows, and back out
from under the yoke the reverend gentleman
was about to place upon his neck.</p>

<p class='c006'>His companion, however, was no novice in
the business in which she was engaged. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>was fearlessly putting forth upon that sea on
which she had twice been wrecked, but she was
nothing loth to try it again. Were she only
skilled in navigation as well as in embarkation,
she would have been the one to send on expeditions
to either the North or South Pole, as the
case might be.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was truly encouraging to the timorous and

regarded her husband that was to be; and with
what a readiness she responded to the momentous
question propounded by the minister.
And when they stood as husband and wife, her
Milesian face lighted up with irrepressible joy,
until it beamed like a Chinese lantern.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her emotions went far to convince me that
there is in those matrimonial fields a balm for
every ill; a perfect bliss worthy the seeking,
even at the risk of receiving the bruised spirit,
if not the bruised head.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DUDLEY AND THE GREASED PIG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Boil-stricken Job had his comforters,
who, despite his timely injunction, “Oh,
lay your hands upon your mouths, and thereby
show your wisdom,” would still drum in his ear,
“Hear us, for we will speak.” Poor old Falstaff
had his evil genius in Bardolph, his impecunious
follower, with his “Lend me a shilling.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>And I have my burdensome “Jim Dudley,”
with his “Let me tell you a story.” I was kept
awake last night listening to his crazy yarn
about the “greased pig,” as if I cared anything
about his villainous adventures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, that scrape with the greased pig?
I never told you about it, eh? It’s worth heerin’,
for that was a tearin’ old race, and I came mi’ty
nigh gettin’ shoved out of the village on account
of it, too, now, I can tell ye. Down on me?
Wall, I reckon you’d think so if you heered the
hollerin’ that was gwine on for awhile arter that
race, some cryin’ one thin’ and some another.
‘Tar and feather the cheat,’ one would holler.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Lynch the blamed humbug!’ another would
shout.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Put him in a sack and h’ist him over the
bridge!’ would come from another quarter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A doctor was never so down on a patent
medicine as they were on me arter that race,
especially Parson Coolridge, who was one of
the principal sufferers, yer see.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was May Day amongst ’em, and the hull
village seemed to be out thar enjoyin’ ’emselves.
They had sack races and wheelbarrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>races. That was the day blindfold Tom Moody
ran the wheelbarrow through the grocer’s window,
and Old Shulkin knocked him down with
a ham, and a dog ran away with it. He charged
Tom with the ham in the bill, along with the
broken winder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They had a greased pole standin’ thar with
a ten-dollar greenback tacked on top of it, but
no person could get within ten feet of the bill.
The hungry crowds were standin’ around all
day gazin’ longin’ly up at the flutterin’ greenback,
like dogs at a coon in a tree-top.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t try the pole, but when they brought
out the greased pig—a great, slab-sided critter,
jest in good condition for racin’,—I got sort o’
interested in the performance. His tail was
more’n a foot long, and it was greased until it
would slip through a feller’s fingers like a newly
caught eel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Several of the boys started arter him, but
they’d jest make one catch, and before they
were certain whether they had hold of it, they
would go one way and the hog would go another.
And then the crowd would holler.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was standin’ thar a leanin’ over the fence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>watchin’ of ’em for some time, and I see the pig
was in the habit of formin’ a sort of ring with
his tail; leastwise he’d lap it over so that it
e’enmost formed a knot—all it lacked was the
end wanted drawin’ through. I cal’lated that a
feller with pooty nimble fingers could make a
tie by jest slippin’ his fingers through the ring
and haulin’ the end of the tail through. That
would make a plaguey good knot, and prevent
his hand from slippin’ off. Arter thinkin’ over
it for some time I concluded if I could git up a
bet that would pay for the hardships that a feller
would be likely to experience, I would try a
catch anyhow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I ses to Jake Swasey, who stood alongside
of me, ‘Jake, I believe that I kin hold that
pig until he gins out.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Hold?’ he ses, surprised like and raisin’
his eyebrows just that way; ‘what’s the matter
of ye? hain’t ye slept well? Ye mout as well
try to hold old Nick by the tail as that big,
slab-sided critter.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, now, jest wait a bit,’ ses I; so I went
on and told him what I cal’lated to do, and arter
he looked awhile, he ses, ‘Wal, go ahead, Jim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>I’ll back ye. I reckon we can git any amount
of odds so long as we keep the knot bus’ness
to ourselves.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“So pullin’ off my coat I gin it to Jake to
hold, and jumpin’ on the fence, I hollered, ‘I’ll
bet ten to twenty that I kin freeze to the pig’s
tail till he gins out!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great fish-hooks! you ought to have seen
’em a-rustlin’ towards me. I couldn’t see anythin’
but hands for five minutes, as they were
holdin’ of ’em up, and signalin’, an’ a-hollerin’,
‘I’ll take that bet, Dudley, I’ll take that bet!’
I got rid of what money I had about me pooty
soon, and Jake Swasey was jest a-spreadin’ out
his greenbacks like a paymaster, and arter he
exhausted his treasury he started arter his
sister to git what money she had. I hollered
to him to come back—I was fearin’ he’d tell
her about the knot bus’ness; but he wasn’t no
fool and knowed too well what gals are to trust
her with any payin’ secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old Judge Perkins was thar, jolly as a boy
on the last day of school. Wal, he was holdin’
of the stakes, and his pockets were crammed
chockfull of greenbacks. He was a pooty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>good friend of mine, and couldn’t conceive
how in thunder I was a-gwine to get my
money back.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>JUDGE PERKINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Beckonin’ of me one side—‘Dudley,’ ses
he, kind of low that way, and confidentially like,
‘I know you’re as hard to catch as an old trout
with three broken hooks in its gill; but I can’t
help thinkin’ a greased pig’s tail is a mi’ty
slippery foundation to build hopes on.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“‘Never mind, Judge,’ ses I, winkin’, ‘I can
see my way through.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes, Dudley,’ he ses, a-shakin’ of his head
dubious like, ‘that’s what the fly ses when he’s
a-buttin’ his head against the winder.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal,’ ses I, ‘without the tail pulls out, I
cal’late to travel mi’ty close in the wake of that
swine for the next half hour;’ and with that I
moved off to where the pig was standin’ and
listenin’ to all that was gwine on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fooled round him a little until I got betwixt
him and the crowd, and when he flopped
his tail over as I was tellin’ ye, I made one
desperate lunge, and made a go of it the fust
time. I jest hauled the end through while he
was turnin’ round, and grabbin’ hold above my
hand, rolled it down into the tightest knot you
ever sot eyes on. It was about two inches
from the end of the tail, and he scolloped
around so amazin’ lively nobody could see it.
The crowd allowed I was hangin’ on the straight
tail, and they didn’t know what to make of the
performance anyhow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Go it, piggy,’ I ses to myself, just that
way, ‘I guess it’s only a question of endurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>now, as the gal said when she had the flea
under the hot flat-iron.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The gate was open, and arter a few circles
around the lot, the hog p’inted for it, and away
he went, pig fust and I arter. He ran helter-skelter
under old Mother Sheehan, the fruit
woman, jest as she was comin’ through the
gateway with a big basket of apples on each
arm. I did hate like snakes to hoist the old
lady, bounce me if I didn’t! I would ruther
have run around a mountain than do it, ’cause
you see she had jest been gittin’ off a bed of
sickness that came nigh shroudin’ her, and she
wasn’t prepared for a panic, by any means. I
did my best to swing the critter around and git
him off the notion of goin’ through, but his
mind was made up. Thar was plenty of room
outside for him to pass along without disturbin’
the old lady, but a hog is a hog, you know—contrary
the world over. Besides, he allowed
he could brush me off by the operation, but I
wasn’t so easily got rid of. The money was
up, you see, and I had no choice but to follow
where he led and stick to the rooter till he gin
out. ‘Where thou goest, I will go,’ I ses to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>myself, rememberin’ the passage in the Scriptures,
and duckin’ my head to follow him. I
scrouched down as low as I could and keep on
my feet; for I cal’lated, do my best, the old
woman would git elevated pooty lively.</p>

<p>BAD FOR THE FRUIT BUSINESS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“She hollered as though a whole menagerie—elephants,
kangaroos, snakes and all—had
broke loose. Her sight wasn’t any too clear,
and the whole proceedin’s had come upon her
so sudden that she didn’t exactly know what
sort of an animal was thar. She would have
been satisfied it was a hog if it hadn’t taken so
long to git through. I followed so close to his
hams that she reckoned we both made one
animal. The hog gin a snort when he started
in to run the blockade, and she ses to herself,
‘Thar goes a big hog,’ but about the time she
reckoned he had got out on the other side, I
come a humpin’ and a boomin’ along in my
shirt-sleeves, and gin her a second boost,
throwin’ the old woman completely off her
pins and out of her calculations at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She did holler good, thar’s no mistake
about that.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The crowd hoorayed and applauded. The
older ones of course sympathized with the poor
old woman; but they could do nothin’ more,
’cause the whole catastrophe come as sudden
as an earthquake and nobody seemed to be to
blame. I wasn’t, and they all could see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>plain enough. The young uns went for
the scattered apples, but the pig and I kept
right on attendin’ to business. Now and agin
he’d double back towards the crowd, and
they’d commence scatterin’ every which way,
trampin’ on each other’s feet. Si Grope, the
cashiered man-of-wars-man, stepped on Pat
Cronin’s bunion, and he responded by fetchin’
the old salt a welt in the burr of the ear, and at
it they went, tooth and nail, right thar. A few
stopped to see fair play, but the heft of the
crowd, about three hundred, kept right on
arter me and the hog.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jake Swasey managed to git up pooty nigh
to us once and hollered, ‘How are you makin’
it, Jim?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Fustrate,’ I answered; ‘I cal’late to stick
to this swine through bush and bramble till I
tire him out.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘That’s the feelin’,’ he shouted, and with
that we left him behind. The old judge was a
puffin’ and a blowin’, strivin’ his best to keep
up, and for some time he actewally led the
crowd, but he didn’t hold out very long, but
gradewelly sank to the rear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rod Munnion, the tanner, stumbled and
fell while crossin’ the street. His false teeth
dropped out into the dirt, and while he was
scramblin’ on all fours to git ’em ag’in, a feller
named Welsh, who was clatterin’ past, slapped
his foot down and bent the plate out of all
shape. Munnion snatched ’em up ag’in as
quick as the foot riz, and wipin’ ’em on his
overalls as he ran, chucked ’em back into his
mouth ag’in, all twisted as they were. They did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>look awful though, stickin’ straight out from his
mouth, and pressin’ his lip chock up ag’inst his
nose. You couldn’t understand what he was

<p class='c006'>“Bow-legged Spinny, the cabbagin’ tailor,

home Squire Lockwood’s new suit, and catchin’
the excitement of the moment, tossed the
package into Slawson’s yard, and it bounded
into the well quicker than ‘scat.’ He didn’t
know it though, but hollered to the old woman,
as he ran past the window, to look arter the
package until he got back. Not seein’ any

with her head stuck in a barrel, and flew to
boltin’ of her doors pooty lively. He had been
once to the Lunatic Asylum, you see, and they
were still suspicious of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The crowd thought to head us off by takin’
down a narrow lane, and it was while they were
in that, that they began to surge ahead of Judge
Perkins. He was awful quick tempered, and
pooty conceited, and when bow-legged Spinny
was elbowin’ past him he got mad. Catching
the poor stitcher by the coat tail, he hollered:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>‘What! a miserable thread-needle machine
claimin’ precedence?’ and with that he slung
him more’n ten feet, landin’ him on his back in
a nook of the fence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was the day they buried old Mrs.
Redpath, that the doctors disagreed over. Dr.
Looty had been doctorin’ her for some time for
bone disease. He said her back-bone war
decayin’. He didn’t make much out of it
though, and they got another doctor. The new
feller said he understood the case thoroughly;
he ridiculed the idea of bone disease, and went
to work doctorin’ for the liver complaint. He
said it had stopped workin’ and he was agwine
to git it started ag’in. I reckon he’d have
accomplished somethin’ if she had lived long
enough, but she died in the meantime. When
they held a post-mortem, they found out the old
woman, some time in her life, had swallered a
fish-bone which never passed her stomach, and
eventually it killed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Thar,’ ses Dr. Looty, ‘what did I tell ye?
You’ll admit, I reckon, my diagnosis of the
disease was right arter all, only I made a slight
error in locatin’ the bone!’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“‘Bone be splintered!’ ses the other feller,
‘hain’t I bin workin’ nigher the ailin’ part than
you?’ So they went on quackin’ thar and disagreein’
over her until old Redpath got mad and
hollered, ‘You old melonheads, isn’t it enough
that I’m a widderer by your fumblin’ malpractice,
without havin’ ye wranglin’ over the old
woman!’ So he put ’em both out, and chucked
their knives and saws arter ’em.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But as I was sayin’, that was the day of the
funeral, and while it was proceedin’ from the
church to the buryin’ ground with Parson Coolridge
at the head, with his long white gown on,
we hove in sight comin’ tearin’ down to’ards
the parsonage. The minister was a feller that
actewelly doted on flowers. When he wasn’t
copyin’ his sermons’ he was fussin’ around
among the posies. He had his gardin chock
full of all kinds of plants and shrubs. Thar
you could see the snapdragon from Ireland, the
fu-chu from China, the snow-ball from Canada,
the bachelor’s button from Californy, and every
kind you could mention.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He had noticed the gardin gate was open
when the funeral passed, and it worried him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>considerable. So when he heered the hootin’
and hollerin’, and got sight of the crowd surgin’
down the street, and see the pig and I pointin’
in the direction of the house, he couldn’t go
ahead nohow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Turnin’ around to the pall bearers who were
puffing along behind him, he ses, ‘Ease your
hands a minit, boys, and let the old woman rest
’till I run back and see if that Dudley is agwine
to drive that hog into my gardin. Confound
him!’ he contin’ed, ‘he’s wuss to have around
the neighborhood than the measles.’ With that
he started back on the run, his long, white gown
a-flyin’ away out behind, the most comical lookin’
thing you ever see. And he could run, that
Parson Coolridge, in a way that was astonishin’.
I reckon he hadn’t stirred out of a walk before
for thirty years, and yit he streaked it over the
ground as though it was an every-day occurrence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“His j’ints cracked and snapped with the
unusual motion, like an old stairs in frosty
weather, but he didn’t mind that so long as he
could git over the ground. He was thinkin’ of
his favorite plants and the prospect of their gittin’
stirred up and transplanted in a manner he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>wasn’t prepared to approve. He did jerk back
his elbows pooty spiteful, now I can tell you.
He tried to make the gateway fust, and put in
his best strides. But when he saw he couldn’t,
he hollered, ‘Keep that hog out of my gardin,
Dudley, or I’ll take the law of ye.’</p>

<p>NIP AND TUCK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“‘Don’t git wrathy, Parson Coolridge,’ I
shouted. ‘I can’t prevent the pig from gwine
in. I have hold of the rudder, but I’ll be boosted
if I can steer the ship.’ With that, through the
openin’ we went, pig fust and me arter, and the
hul crowd a clatterin’ behind us. The judge
was amongst ’em, but got left in the hind end
of it, where the women were a-trottin’. The
Parson’s flowers went down with broken necks
quicker than lightnin’. It wasn’t more’n ten
seconds until they were six inches under ground,
for the hog kept a circlin’ around and the hoorayin’
crowd follerin’ arter, payin’ no more
attention to the Parson than if he had been a
young ’un a-runnin’ around. When they saw
the crowd, the pall bearers and most of the
people who were jest follerin’ the remains
through sympathy, turned back on the run and
left the mourners standin’ thar by the coffin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! it was the most excitin’ time the village
ever seed. The ground was too soft in the
gardin for the pig to git around well, and pooty
soon he gin out. I was awful tired, too, and
was hangin’ a dead weight on him for the last
ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“When the boys see the knot on the tail you
ought to hear ’em a-hollerin’, ‘Bets off! bets
off!’ They were set on claimin’ a foul, and surrounded
the old judge demandin’ thar money.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, as the crowd was increasin’ and the
Parson was e’enmost crazy, the judge told ’em
to come with him to the Court-house—he
wouldn’t decide nothin’ in the gardin. As the
hog couldn’t walk, the judge took his tobacco
knife and cut the tail off and took it along with
him to introduce as proof. He decided in my
favor. He said that I had held on to the tail
and touched nothin’ else, and if I managed to
tie a knot while runnin’ I had performed a feat
never before heard of in the country, so he paid
over the money.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Parson Coolridge was the most worked
up of any of ’em. He had legal advice on the
matter, but the lawyer told him to gin it up, for
the judge was on my side. Besides, he shouldn’t
have left the gate open, if he didn’t want the
pig to go in thar. Arter a while he gin up the
notion of suin’ me, but while he stopped in the
village he never got over it.</p>

<p>MORE LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The boys had pictures chalked up on the
fences and shop doors, so that wherever you’d
look you’d see sketches of the Parson runnin’
back from the funeral, and me a holdin’ on to
the pig’s tail. He paid out more’n ten dollars
in small sums to one boy, hirin’ him to go round
and rub out the pictures wherever he’d happen
to see ’em. But every time the Parson would
start out through the village, thar on some fence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>or door, or side of a buildin’, would be the same
strikin’ picture of him, a streakin’ it to head off
the hog, so he would start the rubbin’-out boy
arter that one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One evenin’ he happened to ketch that selfsame
little rascal hard at work chalkin’ out the
identical sketch on the cooper’s shop door, and
the Parson was so bilin’ mad he chased him all
over the village. The young speculator had
bin carryin’ on a lively business, but arter that
discovery thar was a sudden fallin’ away in his
income. I tell ye it made a plag’y stir thar for
awhile, and I reckon if Judge Perkins hadn’t
been on my side I’d have been obliged to git
out of the place.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A BRILLIANT FORENSIC EFFORT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Having learned that a highly-educated and
respectable lady of this city had instituted
a suit in one of our courts for the purpose
of obtaining a divorce from her husband,
I stepped into the hall of justice to learn how
the case progressed. The fact of a young
wife demanding a separation in a country like
this, which is proverbial for its separations, is
nothing to be wondered at, and I was considerably
surprised, on reaching the court room,
to find it so full of people that I could hardly
gain admittance. I was not so much astonished
at the great rush, however, when informed by
the bailiff that the ground on which the lady
rested her case was that her husband snored.
As I entered, the plaintiff’s lawyer commenced
addressing the court. He entered into the case
with the spirit and fire of a Clay or a Webster.
After reviewing and commenting largely upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the testimony given in the case, he ended his
argument in the following words:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p163.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE ADVOCATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now, sir, whatever other people may think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of this application, I take a bold stand, regardless
whose corns or bunions I tread upon, so
long as I put my foot down where it belongs.
We have too many snorers among us. They
are in our places of amusement, introducing
groans and thunder where none were intended
in the play. We find them in our places of
worship, breaking forth in the midst of the
pastor’s prayer, or while he is picturing to the
congregation the wreck of ages and the crash
of worlds. I maintain that this application is a
righteous one; that it is a shot in the right
direction, which will in all likelihood eventually
bring down the game; and were I a judge
invested with power to decide a peculiar case
of this kind, I would show no hesitation, but
grant the plaintiff her natural and very reasonable
request more readily than if the grounds
on which she sued for a separation were drunkenness
or desertion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The absurdity of an irascible wife seeking
a divorce from a husband because he indulges
too freely in the flowing bowl must be apparent
to all. She rushes into the crowded court
room, and, figuratively speaking, catches the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>astonished justice by the ear, as Joab in the
extremity of his distress laid hold upon the
horns of the altar, and requests him to sever
the chafing bonds with his legal shears. Again:
what a pitiable lack of discretion that woman
exhibits who appeals to the court merely because
her husband deserts her, leaving her to
pursue the even tenor of her way. Why, in
nine cases out of ten this is a ‘consummation
devoutly to be wished;’ she is left untrammeled,
and has no husband to support.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will not allude to the many other failings
which wreck the home and put out the cheerful
light of many a hearthstone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, sir, it is with no ordinary thrill of pride
that I espouse the cause of the woman who
seeks a divorce from a snoring husband. I say,
and I may remark that I say it boldly, that I
rejoice it was reserved for me to raise my voice
in her defence. I hold that a man who with
malice aforethought takes from her peaceful
home a tender and confiding maiden without
first informing her of his trouble, commits a
grave and unpardonable crime. The dogs of
justice should be loosened at his heels to hound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>him from Puget’s Sound to Passamaquoddy Bay.
He should be made to repent his villainous act.
Think how the tender nerves of a sensitive
creature must be shocked on being awakened
by such an outburst. Picture to yourself her
husband, not breathing her name in words of
love, but lying flat on his back, and snoring with
the vehemence of a stranded porpoise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, sir, I ask what mercy should be shown
the monster who has himself shown none? He
has doomed a fair representative of that sex
whose presence civilizes ours, to an ever new
affliction and a life of perpetual wakefulness.
What course can she pursue? There are but
two roads. Which shall she take? One leads
to the court room and the other leads to the
cemetery. She must either be freed from her
husband or go down to an untimely grave, perhaps
to have her place quickly filled by another
unsuspecting victim. No, your Honor; this man,
and I regret to say it, this husband and father,
should not be permitted to destroy the peace
and bright prospects of more than one female.
Let it be known to the world that he has ruined
the hopes of a loving wife, let it be blazoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>upon the housetops and upon the fences that
he <em>snores</em>; then let him get another mate, if he

  <h2 class='c004'>VISITING A SCHOOL.</h2>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Accepting an invitation extended by the
principal of an uptown school, I visited
that institution to-day. The masses of young

is something amazingly impressive.

to-day.</p>

<p>FOOT OF HER CLASS.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This article must be embellished with a faithful
sketch of the boy who stood at the head of
his class. How he felt at that moment, I
couldn’t say, never having any experience in
the position myself. He looked happy and confident,
however, and snapped eagerly at the
words as they fell from the teacher’s lips, much
as a hungry dog does at the crumbs falling from
a table. But my sympathies were decidedly
with the little contortionist who stood mournfully
at the foot of her class. I knew how that
was myself. I had been “yar,” and I regretted
I wasn’t a ventriloquist, that I might from afar
whisper in her ear, and assist her over some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>clogging syllables. If she could have gone into
the yard, where I noticed a scholar of the senior
class throwing herself in a delirium of joy,
brought about by a skipping-rope, she would
probably have acquitted herself in a creditable
manner, and won the praise of all, for however
inferior a person may be to another in some
matters, when they can choose their game they
often reverse the order, and peradventure the
poor stammering scholar could have skipped
the skirts off those jogging ahead of her in the
common speller.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A NIGHT OF TERROR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I am not the oldest inhabitant, and don’t
know what sort of storms they used to
have here before the flood; but I’ll wager a
corner lot against a plug of tobacco, that this
section, for the last twenty years, has not
snoozed through a rougher night than the one
just past.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would have been a glorious night for a
revivalist to stir up the masses. Converts
would have crowded in like grists to a mill
after harvest. Since the last great earthquake
I have not felt so much concern about my
future state as I did about twelve o’clock last
night. I arose from bed, and went to rummaging
books, trying to find the description
of a storm that would equal ours. I found the
tempest that Tam O’Shanter faced the night he
discovered the witches, and the one in which
King Lear was cavorting around, bare-headed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and that which made Cæsar take an account
of stock and turn to interpreting dreams, and
jumbled them all together; but the product
was unequal to the fury that was raging without.
There was no more similarity than a
baby’s rattle bears to a Chinese gong.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p176.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A ROUSING EVENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Then I fished out the storm that howled while
Macbeth was murdering Duncan, and tumbled
it in with the others. This addition made things
about even. The “lamentations heard i’ the
air” of Macbeth’s tempest were a fair precedent
of the clamorous uproar from the fire bell
in the City Hall tower. Only an earthquake
was lacking to enable us to say, “The earth
was feverous, and did shake,” or boast a night
outvieing four of the roughest on record, all
woven into one.</p>

<p class='c006'>It had one good effect, however—one for
which poison and boot-jacks have been tried
in vain: it did silence the dogs and cats. Their
midnight carousals were as rare as they were in
Paris just before the capitulation. Quarrelsome
curs postponed the settlement of their little
differences and defiant barks until such times
as they would be able to discover themselves
whether they barked or yawned, and cats
sought other places besides a fellow’s window-sill
to express opinions about each other or
chant their tales of love.</p>

<p class='c006'>I know the rain is refreshing, the wind purifying,
the lightning grand, and the thunder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>awe-inspiring; but as the poor land-lubber
advised, when he was clinging to the spar of
the wrecked vessel, “Praise the sea, but keep
on land,” so I say to those people who want to
prick up their willing ears, like a war-horse, to
catch the sublime rumble of heaven’s artillery,
or sit by their window and blink at the blazing
sky, like a bedazzled owl at a calcium light; but
I know <em>one</em> individual who could have got along
quite as well if there had raged no war of the
elements. He would have slept soundly and
never mourned for what he had lost.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>MY DRIVE TO THE CLIFF.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I am wofully out of humor, and what is
worse, out of pocket, and have just been
settling a bill for repairs to a buggy which was
knocked out of kilter on the Cliff House road
the other day. At the present writing I feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>that it will be some time before I take the
chances of injuring another. The moon may
fill her horn and wane again, the seals howl,
and the ocean roar, but I will hardly indulge in
the luxury of a drive to the beach for many a
day to come. I had a couple of ladies with me.
Splendid company ladies are—so long as they
have unlimited confidence in your skill as a
driver. But they try one’s patience after they
lose faith, and want to get the lines in their own
hands every time you chance to run a wheel
into the ditch, or accidentally climb over a pig
or calf. Those who were with me on that occasion
are not particularly loud in their praise of
my driving. The fact is, I didn’t acquit myself
in a manner calculated to draw down encomiums
in showers upon my head. I drove a span
that day. They were called high-strung animals.
But I don’t like high-strung horses any
more. If they would only run along the track
like a locomotive, I could hold the ribbons as
gracefully as anybody; but I am very much
opposed to all of their little by-plays. This
getting scared at a floating thistle-down, or
grasshopper swinging on a straw, is something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>I don’t approve of in a horse. There is no
reason in it; no profit accrues from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But my trotters were frightened at different
objects at the same moment—one at a snail
peacefully pursuing his way across the road,
and the other at a butterfly winging his wabbling
flight along the ditch. At once they became
unmanageable, and vied with each other
in extravagant antics. From the first the ladies
had no very exalted opinion of my manner of
handling the lines. Even before we were well
under way I had the misfortune to run down a
calf. Then a Newfoundland dog thought to
stop the buggy by taking hold of one of the
hubs, but he made a mis-dive, and shoving his
head between the spokes, kept us company for
twenty rods without any effort on his part whatever.
I also ran over a wheelbarrow loaded
with bricks (the Irishman escaped with a crushed
hat), and overthrew an apple woman’s stand
while turning a corner. I can yet hear ringing
in my ear the shouts and execrations of the old
vender, when she saw the wheels mounting her
baskets and squeezing the cider out of her
choicest bellflowers. Until I passed the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>street I could look back and see the old lady in
her embarrassing situation. There she sat,
caught under the broken table, and kicking
about wildly in frantic efforts to free herself,
while her bonnet was knocked askew by the
fall and stuck on one side of her head in the
most jaunty position imaginable.</p>

<img src='images/p181.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At this point the horses became more frightened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and commenced cutting up strange didos.
Things were getting badly mixed, so much so
that one horse turned his head to the dasher.
The ladies took a hurried view of the situation,
and voting me an incompetent driver, began to
desert me by back-action movements over the
rear end of the buggy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p182.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>BADLY MIXED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>I shall always think that I could have managed
the animals without any difficulty if they
had not both been frightened at the same time.
But with one bucking like a Mexican plug,
evidently bent on crawling under the buggy,
and the other seemingly striving to reach the
stars by an invisible ladder, they were indeed
difficult to control.</p>

<p class='c006'>My companions concluded they had sufficient
buggy riding for one day, and took the cars
into town, while I patched up the harness as
best I could, and returned to the livery stable,
fully concurring with the women folks that as
a driver I was not a success, and that hereafter
promenades would suit me better.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SECOND SIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>A singular case of second sight occurred
in the western part of the city last evening
while I was there. An old Irishman named
McSweegan, who lives in that locality, is the
possessor of a multiplying pair of eyes. That
is, they have the strange faculty of making two
objects of one. This natural endowment is
particularly distinguishable after he has been
indulging freely in strong decoctions of old
rye.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yesterday he was attending a primary election,
at which he expected to be brought before
the public as a candidate for a fat local office.
An influential friend had been intrusted with the
highly important and vital mission of bringing
his name before the delegates, for which service
he was to receive some petty office if the election
was effected. McSweegan stood back in
a recess of the hall, hat in hand, impatiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>waiting to hear the familiar name pronounced.
In fancy, he already listened to the shout of
applause that would follow his nomination. But
he stood with a quiet smile and an attentive ear
in vain. Candidate after candidate was announced,
but the ancient and honorable name
of McSweegan thrilled not his auricular nerves.
The ticket was at last declared full, and he
was not one of the happy number. His friend
had played him false—to use a common expression,
“had gone back on him,” and he was
justly indignant.</p>

<p class='c006'>On his way home he took Lethean draughts
in which to drown his trouble and keen disappointment,
and by the time he reached his
clap-board front was in capital condition for
seeing double. The hour was late as he
entered his house, but he found his industrious
better half sitting at a table sewing by the
flicker of a tallow candle. His red and multiplying
optics were riveted by the wannish
flame, which to him had the semblance of two
well-defined and separate lights. This was an
extravagance that he could not countenance.
To have found his wife up at such a late hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>would have been severe enough strain upon
his already ruffled temper, for he had no wish
to discuss the result of the “Primary.” But
to find her needlessly consuming <em>two</em> candles
showed a wastefulness on her part, evincing an
utter disregard for the low condition of his
exchequer. He was exceedingly provoked,
and with a view of curtailing home expenses,
attempted to puff out one of the flames.</p>

<p>THE ECONOMIST SEEING DOUBLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>After several ineffectual attempts, in which
he scorched his whiskers and eyebrows, he
succeeded, but found himself enveloped in
Egyptian darkness. His rage increased. He
at once accused his wife of blowing out the
“other candle” through spite. Her contradictions
only fanned his fury, and the performance
ended by putting her out of the house
and keeping her out all night—for which unhusbandly
treatment she had him arrested, and
he now languishes in the lock-up.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A STARTLING CAT-ASTROPHE.</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no more.’”</div>
      <div class='line in38'>—<em>Shakespeare.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Last night, soon after retiring, I was made
aware of the exceedingly annoying fact
that a pair of cats had selected the yard under
my window for their trysting-place, and were
behaving in a most demonstrative manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have no objection to cats having their
courtships as well as men; but I see no reason
in their having such a hoodooing time over it,
making night hideous with rascally yowls. There
is, perhaps, nothing more aggravating in life
than to have a little saucy spit-fire of a puss
keep a whole community awake for hours
together, because an admirer of hers happens to
take a moonlight stroll on a neighboring fence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The night wore on. Their inharmonious
chants increased in volume and spirit. Considering
the matter, I came to the conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>that I would rather pay the fine imposed for
shooting in the city limits than lose so many
hours from needed rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>I hastened to procure my shot-gun, determined
to make a scattering amongst them, if
nothing more. As I reached the casement, a
bright flash from the window of an adjoining
house, and a simultaneous patter of shot in the
yard, informed me that some co-sufferer had
taken the initiative in the good work of demolition;
for though wrought to the highest pitch
of ferocity, his nerves were steady and his aim
was sure.</p>

<p class='c006'>He evidently hit them where their nine lives
were centered, and they dropped as they stood
when the fatal tube was leveled. In short—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They died as erring cats should die—</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a kick, without a cry;</div>
      <div class='line'>The faintest rustle in the chips,</div>
      <div class='line'>A slight contraction of the lips,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which brought the pointed teeth in sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they had passed to endless night.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Even as I write (ten o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>) they are
lying in the yard as they fell, a terrible illustration
of sudden transition from noisy debate to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>silent repose. There they lie, to compare small
things with great, like a pair of shipwrecked
lovers, who have clung to each other through
fire and water, and at last have reached the
wreck-strewed beach in body, but not in spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gentleman who owns the yard has just
been out looking at them. After silently surveying
the dead for a long time in silence, he walked
away without disturbing them, pathetically murmuring
the Latin motto, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requies-cat in pace.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A TRIP TO THE MOUNTAINS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I have been taking a flying trip over the
Sierras about which the poet so mellifluously
sings. There were many beautiful
scenes presented during that trip, but abler
pens than mine have described them fully, and
have done them justice, so I will not attempt
to set forth their various charms. It is not my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><em>forte</em>, anyway, and I am free to confess the
fact. Enough for me to describe the excellent
lunch which I had the good fortune to have
along with me, and to speak plainly, I enjoyed
it the most of anything I saw during my trip.
It was no ordinary lunch, however. The back-bone
of it was a nicely-roasted chicken, which
reflected great credit upon both the poulterer
and the kind-hearted young lady who volunteered
to see it through the oven. Ah, that
brisk little lady can prepare a dish fit to set
before the gods. If that is not doing her justice,
tell me what more can be said, and I will
pile it higher. She is worthy of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The virtues of that fowl live in my memory
yet. It was good. If you could meet an old
lady that was a passenger in that car—not the
one with the bunion on her left foot and the
crockery teeth, who mistook me for a minister,
but the mild old lady with glasses that sat
opposite me—she would tell you the same.
<em>She</em> knows. Bless her gentle heart! If she
doesn’t, I would like to know who does. She
partook of the fowl. I saw her looking wistfully
upon it as I dismembered it, and, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>I say it myself, I am not greedy, by any means,
so I offered her the juicy neck. Did she take
it? Ask, rather, if a cat that had fasted a
week would take a mouse if she got between
him and his hole? As old Shylock said, “Are
you answered?” She was no novice at picking
the neck of a fowl, either. She manipulated
it in a manner that proved to me clearly
she had a perfect knowledge of its construction.
It was not long—perhaps ten seconds—before
she had it picked as bare as a corkscrew.
She did it with such ease, too; and that’s what
got me. She kept it revolving as rapidly as a
squirrel does the cylinder in his cage. She had
but one front tooth left in her upper jaw. The
intelligent mind will no doubt immediately
picture forth a <em>long</em> tooth; and the intelligent
mind, in so doing, portrays the incisor correctly.
It was, indeed, a long tooth, but it was
just the thing she needed for the business
before her. It seemed to be specially made
for it, as it fitted into every depression or notch
in the neck as nicely as a key into a lock. It
ran around between the vertebræ like a turner’s
chisel, throwing the small particles of nutriment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>far back against the roof of her mouth. It did
me good to see her play around that fowl’s
neck. I grew young again while beholding the
busy scene, and actually regretted that a
chicken did not have two necks, as well as
two legs, that I might repeat the generous
donation, and see the pleasing scene enacted
again. As it was, I won golden opinions from
the old lady.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>NECK TO NECK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>A stout German woman who sat near by
also seemed to be looking upon the chicken
as though she would like to help me make
away with it. With that magnanimity which
was ever my peculiar characteristic, I severed
the pope’s nose from the trunk and proffered
her the delicious morsel, when, to my utter
astonishment and confusion, she whipped out
of her pocket a big bologna sausage the size
of a stuffed club, and shook it triumphantly in
my face, so close that it might have greased the
end of my nose. She actually scouted the idea.
Independent, proud and self-sustaining, these
Germans, and no mistake. She evidently felt
insulted, and delivered herself of a long essay
in the German tongue. She was undoubtedly
giving me to understand that she was able to
furnish grists for her own mill. Of course
that is what she meant. I could tell that by
the way she flourished the bologna, and pointed
to her mouth and stomach. I expected she was
about to whack me over the jaw with the singular looking
weapon, and prepared to dodge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>on the shortest possible notice. But she didn’t.
As if to madden me, she commenced eating
the sausage in a hasty, excited manner, taking
about two inches at a bite. What could I do?
What did I do? Why, let her eat it, of course;
it was none of my business. I had no objection,
so long as she didn’t choke, and render it
necessary for me to pat her upon the back,
which I certainly thought I would have to do
before she finished her meal.</p>

<p class='c006'>You may be sure I offered no more chicken
to any person after that, but picked the bones
as bare as pen-holders. If she liked bologna
better than a choice piece of fowl, it was her
fault, not mine. I washed my hands of the
whole affair.</p>

<p class='c006'>I stopped a few hours at a mill in the mountains,
and while there witnessed an amusing
incident. There was a small pipe leading from
the engine, and projecting through the side of
the building close to the ground. Through this
pipe the waste water was conveyed from the
engine, and at the end of it quite a puddle or
drain had been formed, about a foot in width
and eight or ten feet in length. The constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>dripping from the pipe kept the water warm,
and from it a steam was continually rising.
There were several Indian camps in the vicinity
of the mill, and as wood was rather scarce, the
squaws belonging to the camps were in the
habit of congregating around this warm drain
when the cold weather numbed their poorly
protected limbs. It was not an unusual thing to
see half a dozen coming down the hill to squat
beside the drain, and there sit for hours discussing
the current topics of the day, enjoying
at the same time the luxury of a cheap steam
bath.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were a couple sitting at the drain in
this innocent manner while I was at the mill.
I called the engineer’s attention to the capital
opportunity that lay before him to give them a
surprise that would be fun to behold. This he
could do by simply turning a gauge cock and
allowing the steam to go out with a rush upon
the squatting pair. The engineer was a sober
sort of man, not at all given to humor, and not
inclined to take advantage of the opportunity.
But when I informed him that I represented an
illustrated paper and wanted to make a stirring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>sketch of the scene, he consented for my benefit.
As he went to comply with my suggestion, I
moved to the window to see how the squaws
would enjoy it. I had hardly reached my position
when the steam shot along the surface of the
water like smoke from the muzzle of a rifle. At
the same instant the gentle savages shot at least
four feet into the air, in the most extravagant
positions imaginable. Until that moment I
would not have believed the human form could
assume such strange attitudes on such short
notice. If I had not been intently gazing upon
the pair as they sat chatting sociably over the
drain, and had my eyes riveted upon them as
they shot aloft, I could hardly have thought the
two dark figures performing such grotesque evolutions
in mid air were indeed human beings.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p203.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>STEAM LET ON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The steam was harmless, as it had to go quite
a distance before escaping, but the squaws didn’t
understand anything about that, you know. No
person had enlightened their untutored minds
upon that point, and they didn’t sit there very
long in order to ascertain; for the sake of the
squaws, however, let us hope that it was. One
thing they evidently <em>did</em> feel certain about, and
that was that something had broken loose, and
that, too, at a very inopportune moment. The
thought that followed close upon the heels of
the other was to change their position in the
shortest possible time. If they both had been
shot into the air out of one mortar they could
hardly have shown greater concert of action.
If there was any difference in their sensitiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>or agility, the one farthest from the pipe seemed
to claim the superiority, for, as near as I could
judge, she was first to spring aloft. The back
of one was towards me, and the face of the
other. Though quite a distance from them, I
could distinguish the white eyes of the latter
standing out as prominently as a pair of silver-headed
nails in the end of a mahogany coffin.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be argued that this was a mean trick.
It may even be said that it was a sinful act. I
admit all this; nay, more, it may be that I will
have to answer for it hereafter, when you, and
they, and all of us, have ceased to be interested
in things pertaining to the flesh; but in the face
of this supposition, I must still adhere to the
original assertion that it was indeed an amusing
incident, and will go further and say that as yet
I have not been brought down to that perfect
state of repentance where I could sincerely say
that I regretted having been the instigator of
the deed.</p>

<p class='c006'>I never learned whether the squaws returned
to the drain again, but, judging from the way
they hustled over the hill in the direction of
their camp, I am inclined to think not.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>While coming down the river there was quite
an excitement on board, on account of the
steamer grounding suddenly upon the “Hog’s
Back.” She was running pretty fast at the
time, and the sudden stop threw several passengers
off their feet, and for a few moments
all was confusion. I was partly disrobed at the
time, and the first thought that entered my mind
was that we had collided with some schooner
on its way up the river. Before leaving, a
gentleman placed a lady and two small children
in my charge, and my first act was to run to the
state-room in which they were. I found the
lady preparing for rest, but the children were
already in bed. Without much ceremony, I
seized a child in each hand, and bidding the
lady to follow, started to deposit them near the
davits, that they might be handy to throw into
the boats in case we were compelled to take to
them.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>“BLOW ME UP!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While hastening through the cabin I was confronted
by a terrified woman in her nightclothes,
who jumped out of her state-room as
I was passing the door. In her hands she
grasped the nozzle of a large life preserver,
which she had buckled around her, and which
only needed to be inflated with wind to make
her comparatively safe. No sooner did she see
me than she commenced dancing frantically
around me in the most insane manner, at the
same time shouting with all the strength of her
voice: “Blow me up! blow me up! for the love
of heaven, Mister, blow me up!” But I had
enough to do at that moment without stopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to “blow her up.” Besides, I didn’t know but
I might have to swim to the shore, and would,
consequently, need what little wind I could
muster to bear me through the task. Before
proceeding far, however, I met the mate, who
told me to put the children back in bed and go
soak my head, or do anything that would keep
me from making an unmitigated fool of myself,
with which kindly suggestion I meekly complied.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>AN IMPATIENT UNDERTAKER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Now and then we come across a scoundrel,
an inhuman wretch, of such magnitude
that we are inclined, like Bassanio, to waver in
our faith, and hold opinion with Pythagoras,
that being the only hypothesis by which we are
enabled to account for their being possessed of
such brutish natures. For example: An undertaker
was pointed out to me to-day who follows
so close in the wake of death that he quite often
appears in advance of the grim leveler, and
secures, if possible, the job of burying the body
while yet the person is alive, much as he would
bespeak a quarter of beef of his neighbor before
the animal was butchered. This individual heard
that a man was about to die in the County
Hospital, and learning that the only friend of
the sick man was about to leave the city, he
hunted him up and solicited the job of performing
the last sad rites for his friend when death
should have gathered him in.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The request was unthinkingly granted, and
sufficient money to cover the expenses of the
burial was placed in the hands of a third party,
who was to pay it to the undertaker when
the obsequies were performed. The man of
coffins departed, smiling over his success. The
only thing that remained now between him and
a fat profit was the man’s life; but this was only
a slim barrier and likely to fall at every breath
of air. He paid semi-daily visits to the hospital
to learn how the disease was developing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each morning as he arose and looked out
upon the cold fog hanging over the city, he
rubbed his hands with delight, and chuckled as
he thought how impossible it would be for the
sick man to live through such a disagreeable
day. “It’s not in the nature of the disease to
allow it,” he argued. “If he is not gone already,
he will be as stiff as a piston-rod before
ten o’clock, or I am no judge of cause and
effect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But somehow the last thread of life was
indeed a tough one, and held out wonderfully.
One, two and three days dragged by, and still
the invalid’s cough waked the echoes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>corridors and halls of the hospital. This annoyed
the anxious undertaker terribly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What if he should recover, and cheat me
out of the money, after all?” thought he, as he
sat in his gloomy office and gazed about upon
the coffins standing on their ends around the
room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then his small gray eyes lingered longer
upon the cheap burial case in the corner—which
he thought would about fit the man in the
hospital. “There’s no use of this delay,” he
muttered to himself. “There must be some
outside influence brought to bear upon him,
and that immediately, or the fellow may linger
along through the whole winter, and keep the
money lying idle that is now almost within my
reach.” Taking a tape measure in his pocket,
he repaired at once to the hospital, and gained
admittance to the sick man’s room.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor fellow was lying apparently in the
last stages of that deceptive disease, consumption.
But instead of thinking he was so far
gone that his obsequies had actually commenced,
he was promising himself long, happy years of
life and usefulness. The unfeeling scoundrel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>approached the bed and deliberately proceeded
to measure the poor fellow for his last outfit, in
the meantime keeping up a sort of rattling conversation,
like the following: “Hello! old boy;
so you’re going to peg out, eh? Well, it’s a
road that sooner or later we’ve all got to travel;
so there’s no use of a feller making any bones
over it. Rather young, though, to have to
stiffen out; without even having the pleasure
of being married—there won’t be no such
enjoyment where you’re going, the Scripture
tells us. There—that’s a good fellow; stretch
out full length, so that I can get a correct measure.
If there is anything I do dislike it is to
see a corpse stuck into a coffin that’s too short
by a few inches. I would rather pinch a fellow
a little in width than in length, ’cause it
doesn’t cripple a corpse up so bad. There—that’s
it to a dot; five feet nine and a quarter,
with half an inch allowed for the stretching out
of the joints just as you are going off. You
know a fellow elongates a little about that time,
so I always make some allowance when I measure
a live man for his coffin. Now for the
depth, my hearty! Jerusalem! a general caving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>in all along the line, eh? Why, you’re as flat as
a griddle-cake. Ah! that consumption is the
thing that plays hob with a fellow! it <em>is</em>, my
boy, there’s no use denying it. It scoops a person
out mighty quick, I can tell you. Four and
three-quarters—four and a-half—pinch measurement.
Why, blow me, if it doesn’t seem
like a waste of material to give you the standard
depth. If it wasn’t for your long feet I would
be inclined to shallow a little on you, old boy!
Let me think now,—why, what a numbskull I
am, to be sure: I can twist your feet crosswise
a little, and make a go of it like a charm; but
hold on,—no, I can’t do it after all, for there’s
your nose sticking up at t’other end, and it
wouldn’t hardly be doing the fair thing by you
to twist your head around ear up, for the sake
of saving a few inches of material, no sir e-e. I
wouldn’t do that sort of thing to the deadest
corpse I ever screwed a lid over; I’ll do the
fair thing by a man, be he dead or living,
though it should keep me poor. I can give
you the juvenile handles, though, for you
don’t weigh any more than a Cape Ann codfish.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“You’re going off the reel at a favorable time,
too, for I’ve been wishing for a chance to give
my light team an airing, for some time. Old
Skidamadink over on Market street, I hear, is
going to take out a stiff one to-morrow afternoon
also, and no doubt he will be trying to forge
ahead of me the way he did yesterday when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>had the spavined grays along; but he’ll find out
that he has got to limber up a little differently
when Moll and Kate are stuck in his flank. He
wouldn’t have shook me off yesterday, if I hadn’t
that soggy old sea captain aboard. He seemed
to grow heavier the longer I kept him. If there
is any one thing I dislike more than another it
is a pussy corpse. It is bad enough to have a
fat person about you while living, but when they
come to peter out it’s worse,—you can’t chuck
them under the ground too quick. I had the old
emblem of mortality packed away in an ice chest
for three weeks, waiting for his wife to come
down from the Mountains to attend the funeral,
but she finally sent down word that she had got
married again, and if she knew the duties of a
wife—and she thought she did—her place was
alongside of a living husband rather than traipsing
after a dead one. Oh! these women are
terribly slippery sweetmeats the world over.
How fast they get over anything, crying one
minute and singing the next. Well, well, I often
wonder whether they have the genuine feeling
that we men have.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, business is business. There—now let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>me fold your arms across until I get the width;
so we go, so we go, steady, there you are, that’s
it, that’s the posish; natural and easy as death
itself. Whew! there it is again, never knew it
to fail, follows as naturally as the fruit does the
blossom; broad across the shoulders, sure sign
of consumption; show me a person broader at
the shoulders than at the hips and I will show
you an individual that is not long for this world;
never knew a person of that build that didn’t die
of consumption; never, sir; bound to cave, no
getting around or climbing over it; might as
well be knocked in the head at birth, for they are
sure to go some time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, time is crowding, I must be off, as I’ve
got to rustle around in order to have things
ready for you. I’ll expect to find you over your
troubles in the morning, so I’ll say good-bye now,
while you can appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus did the inhuman scoundrel rattle along
while his poor victim lay paralyzed with fear;
hope, at every word uttered by the monster,
deserting his breast, and despair usurping the
vacant seat. With gaping mouth and wide open
eyes he watched each movement of the undertaker.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>His face seemed to be all eyes as he
stared at the bustling trader in death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hope of the visitor was, that a speedy
death would follow this disconsolate harangue;
but happy to relate, patients sometimes recover
after doctors have devoted them to the yew-tree
shade; and strange as it may seem, the patient
in question suddenly improved, as though frightened
by the undertaker into health instead of
into his coffin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day he sat up in bed. On the
second he sat by the window. The third day he
took an airing on the veranda, and passed the
time of day with the undertaker who happened
to be going by. In ten days he took his carpetbag
in his hand and bade good-bye to both
doctors and undertaker, and started to join his
friend in the country.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DUDLEY’S FIGHT WITH THE TEXAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The poor cur, kicked and scalded during the
day, at night can lie and lick his sores in
peace. The scudding hare that can hold out
ahead of the baying beagles, until black Hecate
waves her wand between the hunters and the
hunted, may hope to shake them off. The
aeronaut, tiring of the clamor here below, can
rise above the busy haunts of men and hold
sweet communion with the gods in quiet. But
I, alas, find no escape from the inexorable
plague, “Jim Dudley.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He comes upon me like a thief in the night
and mars my rest. Within the holy sanctuary
even, he whispers in mine ear. Through the
busy marts and thoroughfares he haunts me
still; and tells of fights and hair-breadth escapes,
with all the glibness of an old battle-scarred
veteran who has primed his firelock in
three campaigns. He talks of drawing deadly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>weapons as a dentist would of drawing teeth.
In all likelihood the fellow never drew a weapon
in his life, except, perhaps, at a raffle. I had
long noticed a scar on “Jim’s” forehead, but
never ventured to ask him how he got it, fearing
a story would follow. Last night he detected
me looking inquiringly, and without any query
on my part the following infliction fell upon
me:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see that scar that looks somethin’ like
a wrinkle, over my left eyebrow, don’t ye?
Wal, you can’t guess how I come by that. Cow
kicked me? No, not by a long chalk, nor a
hoss nuther. I got that scar the summer I was
gwine through Texas. I’ll not forget how I got
it nuther in a hurry, for I never did have sech a
narrow dodge since the night dad’s old house
burned down and I got out through the cellar
drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was travelin’ towards the border of Texas,
gwine away back of Waco, and arter I got as
far as cars would take me I set out on hossback.
One evenin,’ jest as I was gettin’ into a small
village, my hoss got one of his legs into a hole
in the road, and fallin’ over, broke it snap off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>below the knee. I felt mi’ty bad over it,
because I didn’t have any too much money
about me; but I had to leave him thar and go
into the village on foot, carryin’ the saddle
along, for I cal’lated to git another animal the
next day and continue my journey. I put up
for the night at a small hotel, and thar was quite
a number of fellers a settin’ around the bar-room
talkin’; but amongst ’em was one big, ugly-looking
villain, with a glass eye that was continewally
droppin’ out and rollin’ across the floor
like a marble. Pupil up and pupil down, it
would move along under chairs and tables, the
most comical lookin’ thing you ever sot eyes
on. He would walk after the truant, glarin’
around with the other eye as though watchin’
to see if anybody was laughin’ at him. Then
he would pick it up and chuck it back into his
head ag’in, as if it was a pipe that had dropped
out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He seemed to be a bully amongst ’em, for
when any of the other fellows went to pass they
circled around him, somethin’ like a woman
around a hoss standin’ on the sidewalk. I
judged by that they were skeered of him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>didn’t want to git anywhere near his corns lest
they might accidentally touch ’em.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>BILL AFTER HIS GLASS EYE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I sat thar watchin’ of him for some time,
and at last, while he was leanin’ on the counter
beatin’ time with his fingers on top of it, a
feller come in and called for somethin’ to drink.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The bar-tender gin him the bottle and he
poured out a drink and left the glass settin’ on
the counter, while he turned around to drop his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>quid of terbacker. As he was doin’ it the big,
bully-lookin’ customer h’isted the glass, drained
it right thar, and smacked and licked his lips
arter it as though wishin’ thar was more of it,—somethin’
like a young widder arter ye give her
a kiss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The feller that ordered the drink turned
back, wipin’ his mouth, gettin’ ready to swaller.
When he see the empty glass he riz up sort of
indignantly, and was agwine to say or do somethin’,
but when he see who it was, he changed
his mind pooty sudden, and settlin’ down about
six inches, turned around and jest slid away
easy like out of the room. As he was gwine
out I could see his ears looked as though they
were freezin’, for they were gettin’ whiter and
whiter as he moved along down the steps. As
I was thinkin’ about it, a ministerial-lookin’
man come edgin’ up to me and ses:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You’re a stranger in this quarter, I believe,
and let me gin you a little advice; it may prove
valuable to ye before you git away from yer.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Why, what’s the matter?’ I asked, wonderin’
what he was comin’ at, ‘have you got the
smallpox in the house?’ I contin’ed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“‘Smallpox!’ he answered. ‘Wuss nor
that, stranger; for the love of peace,’ he contin’ed,
‘keep clear of that feller at the counter.
Let him hev his way. You mout as well undertake
to cross a crater as him in any of his bullyin’
tantrums. Now mind I’m tellin’ ye. If
his eye falls out, don’t laugh at it, don’t betray
yer emotions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘If he steps on yer corns, take it as if old
Jupiter hisself had reached down his foot and
trod on ye, and you’ll come out of it better than
if you <em>did</em> object, a mi’ty sight.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Who is he?’ I inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Why, that’s Bill Cranebow,—Glass-eyed
Bill, they call him. He’s had more fights over
that glass eye of his’n than ever a dog had
over a sheep’s shank.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Everybody’s afeared of him. They hate
him wuss than a lawyer does a peacemaker.
No one who knows him wants to undertake the
job of gettin’ away with him; they’d ruther let
it out to strangers. Oh! he’s lightnin’ at a
fight, for all he looks so clumsy. What the
butcher is with the cleaver, that Glass-eyed Bill
is with the bowie-knife. He knows jest where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to strike to open a jint or git betwixt two ribs.
You’d think to see him at it, he had practiced
for twenty years with some old doctor, by the
way he can disarrange the “house we live in,”
as the poet ses.’</p>

<p>THE MINISTERIAL LOOKING MAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, that’s sort of curious,’ I ses; ‘ain’t
thar no person around this section that has had
any experience at the cuttin’ business? He’s
only human, I reckon. If he gits a poke between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>wind and water he’s as likely to wilt as
anybody else, isn’t he?’ I ses, jokin’ly, jest that
way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Thunder and mud!’ exclaimed the ministerial-lookin’
man. ‘You’ve bin used to fightin’
with women, I reckon. Lose his strength?
You mout as well try to kill the strength of a
red pepper cuttin’ it up, as that feller. Why,
I’ve seen that Glass-eyed Bill in some of his
fights yer, when he was so cut and slashed
apart that you could see his in’ards workin’ like
a watch. And I’ll be called a down east noodle,
if he didn’t stand up to his work like a barber
until he got through with his man. He likes to
fight in a dark room best, though, ’cause thar’s
no chance of gittin’ on the blind side of him
thar; and the landlord not long ago fixed up
one on purpose to accommodate him, he had so
much fightin’ to do. He’ll work a quarrel out
of the least thing. Laughin’ at his eye rollin’
off is as certain a way of gettin’ into trouble as
runnin’ ag’inst a wasp’s nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Though he smokes like a coalpit himself, I
knowed him to pick a quarrel with a young
Georgian and kill him, because he happened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>send a whiff of smoke in the direction whar he
was settin’. Ever since that, whenever he
comes into the room, you’ll see the fellers
a-pluckin’ and a-snappin’ thar pipes out of thar
mouths and crammin’ ’em into thar pockets or
under thar coat-tails—anywhere to git ’em out
of sight, like boys who are jest learnin’ the
habit when they sight thar dad a-comin’ along.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Take my advice and keep away from him,
for he’s dead certain to pick a muss with
strangers, as they ginnerally resent his insults.
Plague on him!’ he contin’ed, ‘I wish he’d go
away from the door, I want to git out; but it’s
not good policy to go a-scrougin’ past him
while he’s lookin’ so alfired glum.’ With that
the old man went quietly over to a cheer in the
corner and sat down—somethin’ the same as a
monkey does when a larger one is dropped into
the cage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I went to bed pooty early that night, as I
was plaguey tired. In the mornin’ I learned
thar had been a fight in the dark room betwixt
Glass-eyed Bill and a Tuscaloosan. Bill, as
usual, had killed his man. I began to wonder
whether I’d git into some scrape or another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>before I’d leave, and as there was to be an
auction sale of horses and mules that mornin’
right thar at the hotel, I concluded to make a
purchase and git away as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I bid two or three times on horses, but they
run ’em up too high. At last they fetched out
a big mule, and thinkin’ that would be jest the
thing, I went for him pooty strong, and succeeded
in gettin’ him. Glass-eyed Bill had
bin settin’ on the door-step thar, and didn’t seem
to be takin’ any part in the biddin’; but when I
went to lead the mule off, he hollered:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Whar are ye a-gwine with that critter?
Leave him standin’ thar, please; I kin attend
to him myself, I reckon.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal,’ ses I, jest slow and easy, that way,
for I wanted to keep down my rizin’ temper,
knowin’ what I was when I got mad, ‘if I’m any
judge of auctioneerin’, the mule is mine, and I
cal’late to lead him away when and whar I
please.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just then the same old ministerial-lookin’
man come chuckin’ and pullin’ at my coat, and
ses he, ‘I’m takin’ ruinous risks in speakin’ to
ye now,’ he ses; ‘but I tell ye again, don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>cross him; let him have the mule, or you’ll
expire quicker than a spark when it drops into
a b’ilin’ pot. He doesn’t want the mule no
more than a husband wants two mothers-in-law;
but he’s jest pinin’ to git ye into a muss, and he
doesn’t see any way of doin’ it without he disputes
the mule with ye. Let him have it, or
it’ll be wuss for ye; now mind what I’m tellin’
ye.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No, I’ll be shot if I will!’ I answered.
‘He ain’t a-gwine to wipe his hoofs on me until—arter
I’m dead, anyhow.’ And with that I
began to move away with the critter, when
Glass-eyed Bill jumped up from whar he was
settin’ and shouted pooty snappishly like, ‘Hold
on thar! drop that rope, unless you want to
collapse so quick that one-half of ye will be in
etarnity before the other half knows thar’s anythin’
amiss.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘On what groun’s do ye claim the critter?’
I asked, jest a-b’ilin’ inside, but keepin’ sort of
cool outwardly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Words doesn’t amount to a woman’s
sneeze in settlin’ a matter of this kind,’ answered
old Glass-eye.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“‘What does, then?’ I inquired, quite innocent
like, as though I didn’t know what he
meant; though I did know sure enuff what he
was drivin’ at.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘This does!’ he answered, rizin’ up and
puttin’ his hand behind him, as I do now, and
jerkin’ out a rippin’ great knife about as big as the
colter of a plow. ‘That’s the sort of a thing to
settle disputes with. No gentleman will argue
a case while he’s got an arbiter like that to leave
it to,’ he contin’ed, a-slappin’ it down flatways
into the palm of his left hand as he spoke, and
bringin’ an echo from an old barn that stood
near.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see the bystanders began to turn pale as
whitewashed chimneys, and commenced lookin’
at the ground as though huntin’ for straws or
splinters to pick thar teeth with, but they only
wanted some excuse to git away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Supposin’ I should pull out a knife about
seventeen inches and a half long,’ I ses, jest that
way, ‘what then?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It’s jest exactly the thing I want to see,’ he
answered quickly. ‘A young mother was never
more tickled when she discovered the fust tooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>a-peepin’ out of her young un’s gums, than I
am when I see a knife comin’ out of its sheath
in a feller’s hand.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, I reckon you must have been brought
up in a fightin’ settlement,’ I ses, jest like that,
for I couldn’t hardly keep from jokin’, he seemed
so amazin’ eager.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Come, which’ll ye do? gin up the mule or
fight? You’ve got to do one or t’other,’ he ses,
impatiently, as he stooped to pick up his glass
eye, which jest then dropped out and was a-rollin’
under the hoss trough.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal,’ I ses, ‘I ain’t perticularly stuck arter
fightin’, but it’s bad enough for a feller to squirt
his terbacker juice onto you, without wantin’ to
rub it in; and if it’ll be any accommodation to
ye, I’ll fight fust and then take the mule arterwards.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Enough sed,’ he answered, just short that
way; and then turnin’ to the landlord who was
standin’ in the door, he asked, ‘Is the dark room
ready for use?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No, not quite, he answered; ‘thar’s some
pieces of that long Tuscaloosan lyin’ around in
thar yet, I believe, but I’ll attend to removin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>them right away,’ and he started off with a
bucket and dust-pan.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>STARTLING DISCLOSURES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“So we all went into the bar-room, and staid
round thar waitin’ until the place would be prepared.
While we were thar, Glass-eyed Bill
pulled out his knife, and commenced to draw it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>backwards and forwards over his boot-leg, as
though to git a fine edge on it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, you can whet your great scythe blade,’
I ses to myself, kind of low that way, for I allowed
he was doin’ it to skeer me. ‘It ain’t allers the
longest horned cow that does the most hookin’.
 my old terbacker shaver has got p’int
enough on it to inaugurate a new passage to the
interior if it <em>won’t</em> cut a har.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arter a while he leaned over to a feller
that sat by the table, and while runnin’ his
thumb sort of feelin’ly along the edge of the
knife, he ses: ‘The man I bought this from in
Galveston assured me it was the best of steel;
but he lied, I reckon, for I turned the edge of it
last night on that long Tuscaloosan’s ribs. Yet
that’s not to be much wondered at, arter all, for
I do believe he had as many ribs as a snake. I
thought I never would succeed in gettin’ the
blade betwixt ’em. Arter I got him down in
the corner and his knife away from him, I commenced
jabbin’ at his armpit, and I prospected
the hull way down to his kidney, before I could
git in far enough to let his dinner loose.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gewillikins! When I heered him talkin’ like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that, didn’t I begin to squirm and fidget around
on my cheer! I wished then I had never seen
the place, more especially the long-eared mule.
But I see I was in for it, as the boy said when
he got his head stuck in the cream jar. Thar
was no way of gittin’ out without comin’ right
down to beggin’ off, and I was too consumin’
proud to do that, you know, if I was sartain of
bein’ cut up into as many pieces as a boardin’-house
pie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jest then the landlord came back and sed
the room was ready, but remarked that it was
a leetle slippery yet. He sed, for a lean man he
never did see a feller that had so much blood
into him as that Tuscaloosan had. Beckonin’
me to the counter he ses:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You mout as well settle your bill now
before you go in thar; it may be more satisfactory
to you to have the settlin’ of your own
affairs, and it’ll save me the trouble of huntin’
over your effects arter you’re dead.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘All right,’ I ses, ‘now, if you say so; but
it’s ginnerally admitted that sure things sometimes
git mi’ty slippery all to wunst, and perhaps
somebody’s goggles may prove blue in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>the mornin’ that were bought for green uns
at night.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t want to let any of ’em think I was
skeered, though, by jingo! I felt sartin of bein’
minced up, and the cold chills were jest streakin’
all over me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So we started for the room, which was about
twelve feet square and dark as pitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The landlord held the door open until we
were in opposite corners with our knives out.
Then he shut and locked it and left us to work
out our own salvation, as the missionary did the
South Sea Islanders when he overheerd ’em
talkin’ about the best way of cookin’ him the
next mornin’.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wasn’t it dark in thar though? and still?
you could have heered a lizard a-breathin’ in
thar, it was so quiet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I allowed Glass-eyed Bill was expectin’ that
I would go a-shufflin’ and a-huntin’ around for
him, but I had no sich foolish notion. I cal’lated
if thar was any findin’ to be done he’d have to
do it, for I was detarmined to stand right thar
till I’d drop in my tracks before I’d go a-s’archin’
around for him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“I commenced breathin’ about twice a minute,
and not makin’ any more noise at it than a
wall-bug, nuther. But for all that I heered him
a-movin’ over towards me. I’ll allers think that
Cranebow had a nose onto him like a setter
dog, for he somehow or another got right over
thar whar I was standin’. Pooty soon I felt
somethin’ a-stingin’ along my forehead thar,
and I suspected at once that it was the knife
that was feelin’ around for me; so I reckoned
it wouldn’t be long until he was a-proddin’ of it
somewhere else, and like the boy with the
candy bag, I cal’lated the fust poke was everythin’;
so I made one sudden and detarmined
plunge and a sort of upward rip, at the same
time, cal’latin’ to do all the damage I could right
at once while I was about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He heered me start, and thought to squat
down before I got the knife into him I reckon.
Though his intentions were good he only spread
the disaster, like the gal who tried to put the
fire out with the corn broom, for as he was
gwine down the knife was rizin’, and the result
was truly astonishin’. I’ll be smashed if he
didn’t fly open from eend to eend like a ripe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>pea pod. It was done so alfired quick too,
that he didn’t realize how bad he was hurt
I think. Ses he, ‘We’ll try that over ag’in,
stranger.’ As he spoke, he started to git up,
but fell away seemin’ly in two different directions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Not on this side, we won’t,’ I ses, as I went
huntin’ around for the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was surprised as much as him at the way
things had turned out, for when I stepped into
that room I looked on it as steppin’ into another
world. When the door was found I commenced
knockin’, and pooty soon the landlord came
and opened it. He couldn’t see me at fust, but
allowed it was the bully that was thar, of course,
and ses he:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You made pooty quick work of it this time;
that feller won’t want to buy any more mules
arter this, I take it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No,’ ses I, steppin’ out, ‘nor claim a critter
that doesn’t belong to him nuther.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What!’ he cried, jumpin’ back with a look
upon his face that told me at once he was mi’ty
displeased at the way things war developin’, ‘is
it you? whar’s Glass-eyed Bill?’ he contin’ed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>shadin’ his eyes with his hand and peerin’ into
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘He’s lyin’ around in thar somewhar,’ I answered
careless like, jest that way. ‘The head-half
of him is nigh the door here, paralyzed, I
reckon, but the leg part is somewhere over in
the corner thar whar ye hear the kickin’; you
mout as well be gettin’ yer bucket and dust-pan
ready, for you’ll have quite a job gettin’ all the
pieces together ag’in, I’m thinkin’,’ I contin’ed,
just that indifferent way, and walkin’ out towards
the bar-room as I spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never did see a feller so set back in
your life. He looked at me as though I had as
many heads onto me as the beast we read
about in the Scripters. I’ll allers believe that
he was in cahoot with old Glass-eye, and jist
kept him thar to pick quarrels with strangers
so they could have the pickin’ over of thar
effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arter washin’ my hands and plasterin’ up the
cut on my forehead a little, I went out and saddled
the mule, and the crowd all came out to
see me gwine off. I reckon if I had stopped in
the village I could have had things about my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>own way for some time. Before I rode off I
turned round to ’em and ses:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘When you git so frightened of a bully
ag’in that you daren’t sneeze within forty feet
of him, jest send for me, and I’ll open him up
ready for saltin’ while you’d be wipin’ your
mouth.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“With that I rode off, and left ’em all starin’
at each other, and then arter me, as though wonderin’
who or what I was, anyhow.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A TERRIBLE NOSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I was to-day brought in contact with an old
gentleman named Bickerstaff, who keeps a
crockery store in the village where I am visiting.
This Bickerstaff is the unfortunate possessor
of the queerest-looking nose I have yet
encountered.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not the original intention of Providence
that he should follow such a proboscis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>through life, for there was a time when he, like
other men, had a forerunner ornamental as
well as useful. But through an accident, the
nose he now bears in all its deformity was
shoved upon him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p244.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>BUSTING HIS BUGLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It seems one day, while furiously pursuing a
little urchin who had mischievously put a stone
through a glass jar by the door, he ran his face
against the end of a scantling a boy was carrying
past on his shoulder, and set his nose well
up on his forehead in a triangular lump.</p>

<p class='c006'>Strange to say, no inducements that the surgeon
could hold out served to coax it back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>its former position. His wife, who was young,
and rather prepossessing in appearance, worried
terribly about it. She finally left him, and went
to live with her mother, and immediately set
about obtaining a divorce from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>She would, in all probability, have obtained
it, if she had not died before the case was properly
laid before the commissioners; because she
was capable of doing better, and when you
come to see the nose with which she wished to
sever her connections, you could hardly blame
her. Old Bickerstaff, to tell the honest truth,
did look like the very old Nick in masquerade
costume.</p>

<p class='c006'>His nose, as it reposed between his eyebrows,
displayed an enormous pair of nostrils
large as front-door keyholes. At a short distance
a person would think he had four eyes in
his head. He was the living terror of the
school children who daily passed his place of
business. They either scurried past on the
run, or with their hands over their eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even among creeping infants—who had
often shrunk back from the threshold as old
Bickerstaff passed the door—he was known as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the Boo; and there was no danger of them
crawling into the street while he remained in
the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nervously-inclined women also avoided him.
They would cut across the road when they saw
him coming toward them, or turn back, feeling
their pockets as though they had forgotten
something, and hurry back to go round some
other way.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dogs never barked at him. If they happened
to be engaged in that pastime when he hove in
sight, they would slope off the demonstration
into a yelp. And as if they had suddenly recollected
that they were wanted at home about
that time, they tucked their tails between
their legs and dusted away at a lively rate.
Hitched horses even snorted lustily and pulled
hard upon their halters when old Bickerstaff
shuffled by.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old gentleman had a pew in the church
directly in front of the pulpit, and the first time
he attended divine worship after his nose had
been set up, he threw the minister out of his
discourse altogether. He couldn’t keep run of
what he wanted to say, no way he could fix it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>He had Jonah swallowing the whale, instead of
the whale doing the job for Jonah.</p>

<p class='c006'>No matter how much he endeavored to keep
his eyes in some other direction, they would
invariably wander back to rest upon that terrible
sight, and then he would be off the track again
in a twinkling. The next day the trustees of
the church waited on Bickerstaff, and in the
most polite manner possible requested him to
exchange his pew for one farther removed
from the pulpit.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old fellow—who, by the way, had considerable
temper—flew off the handle at once, and
in the most unchristian-like language denounced
the church and the doctrine that would draw
the line of demarkation between fair faces and
plain.</p>

<p class='c006'>He informed the trustees if the parson
didn’t like the looks of his congregation, he
could turn his pulpit around facing the other
way. Yet, though he was rough in his speech,
and given to storming considerably when his
pride was touched, he was not altogether lacking
in those qualities which go far to make up
your real man; and when the trustees offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>to give him the side pew <em>rent free</em>, his voice at
once grew low, and in a becoming manner he
accepted the situation. After that, things were
not quite as bad. The minister occasionally got
a quartering view of him, but the odd-looking
disfigurement didn’t strike him with full force.
Still, I was informed, the Reverend gentleman’s
discourse was principally addressed to the hearers
on the other side of the church, thereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>But—to his credit be it mentioned—he always
turned in the direction of old Bickerstaff when
he closed his eyes in prayer.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A MASKED BATTERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I learn by an evening paper that an old
lady in the lower part of the city to-day,
while burning some cast-off garments, threw an
old vest belonging to her son-in-law into the fireplace.
A Remington rifle cartridge happened
to be slumbering in one of the pockets. It
awakened, and therefrom hangs a piece of crape.</p>

<p class='c006'>This draws me on to fasten upon paper an
incident that happened in the mountains some
years ago. I was spending a few days in the
mines at the time, with a friend named Colyer,
who was working a claim back of Sonora.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had three partners in the concern. One
was an old fellow named Twitchell, who at some
time in his life had been a judge in a supreme
court in one of the Southwestern States—I
forget which. At all events, they called him
“Judge,” and he bore the title with becoming
dignity.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>
<img src='images/p250.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE ONE-EYED SWEDE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another was a dark-looking, one-eyed Swede,
who wore a large green patch over the empty
socket. This seemed to add a double brilliancy
and fire to the other optic, and gave to him
rather a ferocious appearance. He would have
passed anywhere for a buccaneer of at least fifteen
years’ cruising. Yet he was quite a mild
and peaceable man, for all his demoniacal
aspect. The third was a Vermonter, named
Theodore Arthur Willoughby Spooner, called
Spoon, for short. They occupied a small log
cabin near their claim, and were like miners
generally, hopeful, if not happy.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>One evening Theodore Arthur Willoughby
Spooner was rummaging over some old articles
left in the cabin by a former occupant. Among
them he found an odd-looking pistol which the
rust of years had rendered worthless. The
weapon was an uncommon one. I never saw
anything like it before or since, and it is my
daily prayer that I never may. It was a ten-shooter;
with nine chambers for bullets, and a
tenth and larger barrel for throwing buckshot,
slugs, walnuts, small onions, or potatoes. In
fact it was capable of receiving almost anything
not exceeding a billiard ball in size. Such an
awe-inspiring shooting iron would be invaluable
to a footpad or road agent. It was particularly
suited for men of this stripe; for the man who
would not blanch, settle down on his knees and
surrender up his valuables when that battery
was leveled at his head, must be brave indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>After we had examined it for some time and
vainly endeavored to raise the hammer, the one-eyed
Swede took it. In trying to revolve the
chambers he dropped it unswervingly upon
Judge Twitchell’s favorite corn. It weighed
about as much as a good-sized anvil, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>person who had experienced the peculiar sensation
that shoots along the nerves from an
injured corn, could blame the Judge for indulging
in a little profanity about that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Smarting under the contusion he grabbed the
instrument and in an erring moment flung it
into the fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not a man of that little assemblage but would
have given his day’s pan-out to have the pistol
out of the flames again; but neither wished to
assume the responsibility of poking for it. The
confounded thing hadn’t been fully canvassed,
and we didn’t know whether or not it was loaded
or which way it was aiming. It might be pointing
out at the door, or up the chimney, or it
might be leveled at a fellow’s very vitals; there
was a sort of creeping uncertainty about the
whole thing that was calculated to inspire solemn
and serious reflection, and make us sit uneasily
upon our stools.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were not long in doubt, however, for in
ten seconds after the villainous-looking mitrailleuse
settled into the glowing embers, there was
no foot of space, no nook or corner within the
wooden walls of that humble dwelling, that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>a good place for a man to be who was not fully
prepared to exchange worlds.</p>

<p class='c006'>File firing commenced on the right of the fireplace,
under cover of burning brands. There
was a sharp report, a cloud of ashes and a
shower of coals, and amid the general din the
stem and bowl of the meerschaum in the teeth
of Theodore Arthur Willoughby Spooner dissolved
partnership at once and forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same instant the old water pitcher
jumped from the table mortally wounded in the
abdomen.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the next few moments there was extraordinary
ground and lofty tumbling inside
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not because I was possessed of greater fear,
or less courage, than any of the party, but
because I felt that I had more to live for, I was
the first to reach the open air. The “Judge”
was following close at my heels, but in his blind
haste he tripped in the doorway and blocked
the passage. It was at this critical moment that
the leap-frog performance commenced.</p>

<p>NEEDED AIR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The antics of Chirini’s circus troupe, during
their most brilliant achievements, dwindled into
mere schoolboy exercise when compared with
the gymnastic efforts of the excited miners.
Out came my friend Colyer over the prostrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>form of the Judge, and the one-eyed Swede
over Colyer, his hair erect and his one dilated
eye standing in bold relief from his dark face, like
the ornamental stud on a horse’s blinker. Last
though not least interested or frightened, came
Theodore Arthur Willoughby Spooner, sailing
like a flying squirrel over the one-eyed Swede.
In the meantime the pistol was jumping about
in the fire like a fish in a scoop-net, showering
bullets in every direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The clock hung silent upon the wall, having
received a charge of buckshot full in the face,
and the dog lay dead upon the hearthstone.
“Chickens come home to roost,” saith the old
proverb, and indeed it would seem so, for poor
Judge Twitchell, whose rashness brought about
the whole calamity, received a parting salute, a
farewell shot, just as he had gathered himself
on all fours to make a final lunge from the fusillade
within. Fortunately the wound was not a
fatal one, though severe enough to keep his
memory green for weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some time elapsed before any person would
venture back into the cabin after the firing
ceased. No one had kept count of the shots or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>knew at what moment the battery might open
again. We probably would have remained out
all night rather than take any chances, but the
coals which had been thrown over the cabin,
started a brisk fire in half a dozen different
places, and we were obliged to run some risks
to extinguish the flames and save the place.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Who hath contended for a prize? Who
hath stood in front of an armed host
with a noble emulation warming his breast?
Who, with one eye glancing along the barrel to
the target in the distance, and the other closed
upon the world, hath pressed carefully upon the
decisive trigger? And who hath seen the glittering
bone of contention passing away into
other hands than his at the close of the contest?
If such a person there be, then can he sympathize
with me in this, my dark hour of despondency.</p>

<p>THE BEST SHOT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To-day I entered the lists with eighty men to
compete for a gold watch and chain of two hundred
and fifty dollars in value. It was to be
presented to the winner by the Governor of the
State, at a grand ball in the evening. I, who
prided myself that I was no woman with a gun,
made a very fair impression upon the target;
and fell back. For six long, dragging hours I
watched the marksmen striving to beat my score.
One by one the good shots whom I had reason
to fear stepped forward, discharged their pieces,
and fell back cursing their ill luck. At last
nearly all had fired, and I in fancy could hear
the elegant time-piece ticking in my pocket, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>was already preparing the usual impromptu
speech with which to thank the generous donor.
At this point an individual stepped forward
whom I had not included among my dangerous
competitors, because on former occasions he
failed to hit the broad side of a mountain. Yet
to my astonishment he bore off the glittering
prize!</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall always think the devil rode astride of
that individual’s bullets and guided them into
the target; for while taking aim, the muzzle of
his gun was tossing around like the tip of a
cow’s horn when she’s grazing in a clover field.</p>

<p class='c006'>What a picture was I, as I stood that evening
at the ball, watching his Excellency presenting
the magnificent watch I had for hours together
looked upon as mine. Had I not received the
premature congratulations of my friends, and
been lavish of change at the bar in consequence?
And the watch—where was it? I feel that I
shall never have the face to look my musket in
the muzzle again.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE COUNTRYMAN’S TOOTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Last evening, while sitting in a physician’s
office, I was amused by a countryman who
entered the office to have a tooth extracted.
The doctor took one of the old-fashioned “cant
hooks” and went for the molar, but whether it
was owing to lack of skill or the patient’s ducking
while the instrument was being adjusted, it
became fixed directly between two teeth, and
after a painful struggle, out they both were
drawn. The operator saw he had taken out
two masticators instead of one, and before the
patient noticed the fact, one was chucked under
some papers lying upon the table by his side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jerusalem!” cried the countryman, as soon
as he could speak. “I thought by the yankin’
and the torturin’ pain you had hitched the
blamed thingamagig onto my back-bone and was
a snakin’ it out. Why, bless my soul!” he continued,
as he ran his tongue into the awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>chasm. “Hain’t you made a mistake, doctor,
and pulled out the jaw instead of the tooth?
Thar appears to be a ginneral cavin’ in all
around thar.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no,” said the doctor; “there is the
tormentor, sir,” and he held up the one tooth
before the contorted face of the victim in triumph.
“Your teeth pull out easy, sir, for their
size,” he continued, as he wiped his instruments
and put them away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They do, eh?” he exclaimed. “Wal, dear
help them that have teeth that come out hard.
‘Taint all in the pullin’ nuther, but the incredulous
hole they leave ahind ’em when they do
come. Why, my teeth seem as far apart as two
Sundays to a laborin’ man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The other teeth will crowd over after a
while,” said the doctor, encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It may be I’ll git sort of used to it after a
while,” he replied, “but I’ll be blowed to the
moon, if it doesn’t feel as though my tongue
was wabblin’ around in some other person’s
mouth about this time;” and he arose from the
inquisitorial chair, paid the damages, and left
the office.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MINING STOCKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The city to-day has been in a state of feverish
excitement over dispatches received from
the mining regions. The telegrams were fraught
with startling intelligence. There has been a

going up accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The streets are crowded with men, women

remarked at my elbow—easier for a needle to go
through a camel’s eye, than for a person to pass
through the throng at some of the corners. At
present the person who does not own Savage
stock is not considered of much account. I, who

to-day may reach the summit of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>expectations, to-morrow may bring a descent
that will be something to stand from under.
And being possessed of quite a prophetic soul,
I anticipate the event, and as a companion piece

Savage stock coming down, which it will undoubtedly
be before many days.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>FIGHTING IT OUT ON THAT LINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>While crossing Telegraph Hill this evening
in the vicinity of the beach, I witnessed
an incident which has kept me smiling to myself
for the last two hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>A couple of carters met in a street at a place
which needed repairing. One cart was heavily
loaded with brick. The other contained a small
lot of coal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The driver of No. 1 was in favor of suspending
that time-honored clause in common law,
which says, “turn to the right.” Having the
heavier load he wished to adopt the English
system:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The law of the road is a paradox quite;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For as you are driving along,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you go to the left you are sure to go right,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If you go to the right you go wrong.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But driver No. 2 was immovable as Cæsar
when the conspirators with ready weapons knelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>around him. He was determined to enforce
his prerogative, even to the anchoring of his
opponent’s cart.</p>

<p class='c006'>No. 1 said he would “stand there until his
corns sprouted.” No. 2 replied that he “wouldn’t
budge until his corns not only sprouted, but
until they went to seed, or he would have his
rights.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After considerable loud talk in which they
freely expressed unqualified opinions of each
other, they commenced unhitching their horses
from the carts, as night was setting in, and
quietly started off to their respective stables.</p>

<p class='c006'>It happened they had met directly before the
residence of a stout Teuton who owns a large
brewery at the Beach. They had scarcely left the
disputed point when the brewer arrived. His
flushed face showed he had been freely testing the
quality of his malt liquor. He demanded of
some bystanders how the carts came there.
Being informed of the whys and wherefores to
his satisfaction, he called out his two stout sons
to assist in removing the unsightly ornaments.</p>

<p class='c006'>The united efforts of the three soon started
the carts down the hill, in the direction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>bay, like a battery of flying artillery. It was
only a few rods to the water, and in they
plunged, one after the other, and shot out from
the shore like things of life. The old man and
his sons stood upon the crest of the hill viewing
the descent in silence. After they had been
successfully launched, the trio retired into the
house with that self-satisfied and confident air
that Emperor William and his two warlike
aids might exhibit when retiring to their tent
after a battle in which the enemy was routed.
To some of the bystanders this seemed rather
a precipitate proceeding; but to my untutored
mind it was an act worthy to be ranked with the
judicial hangings by the San Francisco Vigilance
Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I left the hill, I took a last look back at
the carts, fast growing indistinct in the gloom
and mist closing over the bay. One craft was
hugging the shore off Black Point, with a close
reefed tail-board, and her wheel well under
water. The other was sinking by the stern,
but still scudding under bare poles in the direction
of Raccoon Straits.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DUDLEY’S FIGHT WITH DR. TWEEZER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Jim Dudley called again last night, and,
as usual, bored me with one of his yarns.
I overshot myself by mentioning to him how low
he stood in the estimation of Doctor Tweezer,
for that brought down the following upon my
head:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Tweezer didn’t speak very highly of me,
eh! Wal, ’tain’t to be wondered at when you
know how I wrought upon his feelin’s once.
When a feller has to go around among his
patients for more’n two weeks with a beefsteak
the size of a hearth rug tied to his face, as <em>he</em>
did, he ain’t agwine to hurt himself eulogizin’
the person who set him off,—not much.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ever fight? wal, I reckon you’d think so if
you had seen the Doctor’s yard arter we got
through turnin’ the chips over thar. <em>He</em> can
fight, and squirm like a cat with her tail in a
tongs, that Dr. Tweezer can.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“You see the Doctor’s place was alongside
the widder Gezot’s, and she had a numerous
assortment of hens, specimens from cold countries,
with feathers clear down to thar toe nails;
and others from bilin’ hot districts, with no
feathers at all onto ’em, ‘ceptin’ a few downy
substitutes frillin’ around the neck. They were
continually a-gettin’ into his garden and a
sprawlin’ round in the soft beds thar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He was pooty mad over it too, for he prided
himself on razin’ early vegetables, and two or
three times he cautioned her to look arter her
p’ultry, or he’d gin ’em a dose that would warm
thar little gizzards for em’ if he was any judge
of drugs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The widder Gezot was a plaguey stirrin’ little
woman, one that was allers willin’ to flounder
ahead the best way she could. Being myself
somewhat interested in the lady, I used to ginnerally
chime in when she got into any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She soon told me what Dr. Tweezer said
about the hens; so we set in, and poked ’em,
and stuck feathers through their bills, and did
all we could, except wringing their necks, to
keep ’em out of his garden.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“But hens are hens, you know, and the warm
sand makes ’em feel mi’ty nice, I reckon. They
still managed to git through the fence, or over
it, and hold caucuses in the Doctor’s onion
beds. One day arter I had bin down town
talkin’ politics with the boys thar, I was settin’
on the widder’s door-step smokin’ and musin’
like, when I see her hens come a-rustlin’ hum
as though forty hawks were a-stirrin’ ’em up.
They p’inted straight for the water trough, and
after takin’ about two dips into it, commenced
the wildest gymnastic feats you ever see, flip-flopin’
around, stannin’ on thar heads, and then
on thar tails. Finally they quieted down, and
turnin’ feet up, lay thar dead as the chips around
’em.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I more than suspected Dr. Tweezer had gin
’em a dose of arsenic or some other mi’ty tellin’
drug. So I jest riz up quietly and took a look
over into his yard, and sure enough thar he was,
a-staggerin’ and squirmin’ around, a-holdin’ of
his sides, and e’enmost a-bustin’ with in’ard
laughter. Now this sort of upsot me. Not that
I cared so much about the widder’s chickens, but
I didn’t like to see a feller so mi’ty tickled over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>a mean trick. So I went prancin’ around to the
Doctor’s yard pooty durned lively, a-pullin’ off
my coat as I ran. I cal’lated I couldn’t devote
much time to strippin’ arter I got in thar.</p>

<p>GOING FOR THE DOCTOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“His back was towards me, and he never suspicioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>I was comin’, but stooped over warpin’
around and sort of unwittin’ly invitin’ a kick.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It’s mi’ty funny business, a-pizenin’ chickens,
isn’t it?’ I ses, jest that way, and at the
same time I gin him such a hoist, that I sent him
playin’ leap-frog mor’n fifteen feet, and for a few
moments I reckon he thought he had backed up
ag’inst a batterin’ ram.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He was mi’ty cranky though, and turned
round quicker than a dog when his tail is trod on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Dudley,’ he hollered, ‘you meddlin’ ruffian,
you’ve invoked the pest, so now look out for
scabs,’ and with that he came at me like a
cluckin’ hen at a strange dog. I see I was in
for a lively time, as the boy said when he upset
the bee hive. At it we went, ring and twist,
duck and dodge, hop and catch it, round and
round the yard like fightin’ turkeys. I could
play around him at boxin’ like a cooper round
a barrel, but he was grizzly on a hug, and could
kick and gouge like a Mississippian.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He went for my right eye like an Irishman
for a ballot box. I’ll be blowed if I didn’t think
I’d have to go one eye on it ever arterwards.
Several times he had it stickin’ out like a door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>knob. Finally while he was a-fumblin’ around
he accident’ly slipped his finger into my mouth,
and I shut down on it mi’ty fast now I can tell
you.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Fair play! fair play!’ he hollered, ‘no
bitin’.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Rats!’ ses I, jest that way, ’twixt my teeth,
‘all’s grist that comes to my mill, I reckon,’ and
with that I snapped it off at the second jint like
a radish. Jest then his wife, hearin’ an unusual
rustlin’ and scrapin’ around the yard, come
a-runnin’ to the door to see what was up.
Woman like, without inquirin’ into the particulars,
she took sides to wunst, and started with a
dish of hot water cal’latin’ to gin me an alfired
scaldin’. Luckily she stumbled over the dog
that was a-skelpin’ into the house to git out of
harm’s way, and her own young ’un that was
crawlin’ around the floor munchin’ dirt got the
hottest bath it ever experienced. That gave her
somethin’ else to look arter, so that the Doctor
and I had it out alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arter we had bin at it about fifteen minutes
we held a sort of informal truce, just arter a
simultaneous exchange of compliments, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>left the Doctor layin’ across the grindstone and
me astride the pump. It was the first chance I
had of gittin’ a fair look at him, since we started
in. I see he was punished mi’ty bad. One eye
was retirin’ from active service pooty fast, while
his face ginnerally looked as if he had bin bobbin’
for pennies in a dish of tomato sauce. I
reckon he wasn’t aware he presented such an
appearance, for ses he:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You’re lookin’ mi’ty bad, Dudley, and you
mout as well gin up now as any time, for you’ll
eventually have to holler.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘If I looked one-half as bad as you do, Doctor,
I would holler,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I ginnerally have to look about this bad
before my blood gits up to a fightin’ heat,’ he
ses detarminedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal,’ ses I, ‘I’ve fit at every election for
the last five years, and last Fourth, put the bully
mate of Terre Haute into a coal bunker, blind
as a bat, and I cal’late no derned pill-mixer is
agwine to git away with me very bad.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You’ll have to be born ag’in before you
can whale me, Dudley,’ he shouted, ‘for I’ll fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>while there’s enough blood left in me to lunch a
stall-fed musketeer.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘We both suck through the same straw then,
Doctor,’ ses I, ‘for I cal’late to stick to you like
a poor man’s plaster to a beggar’s ribs or I’ll
have the worth of the widder’s chickens out on
ye,’ and with that I spit out his finger that I had
forgot all about, and the hul time had bin
chawin’ like a piece of flag-root, I was so burnin’
mad. I allers will think he would have gin up
the fight then, if he hadn’t seen me spit out the
finger. He looked down at his maimed hand
and then at me, and the awful sight seemed to
spur him on ag’in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You cannibal varmint!’ he hollered, as he
edged up to me. ‘I’ll make head-cheese of ye!’
and with that he made a pass at me; so at it we
went ag’in, hotter than ever, hands up and heads
down like fightin’ wasps, round and about, over
the goose-house and wheelbarrow spat-a-te-kick,
and down into the sink pool roll-et-e-roll,
and the hair was a-flyin’ and the teeth war a-spinnin’.
I got in a left-handed wipe on his
chin while his mouth was open, swarin’, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>made his jaws snap like a wolf trap, and sent
one of his molars a-buzzin’ through the kitchen
winder like a bullet from a Springfield muskit.</p>

<p>HANDS UP AND HEADS DOWN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I never knowed a man could lose so much
blood and stand up arter it, until I had that
fight with Dr. Tweezer. The blood was a-flyin’
from him every which way, like the water from
a sprinklin’ cart, and yet he wouldn’t holler.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arter a while he clinched and throwed me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>but I managed to turn him, and commenced to
shut off his supply of wind by twistin’ his necktie;
but jest as his tongue began to crop out
promisin’ly, a couple of fellers drivin’ by in a
wagon seen us, and they allowed that I was
one of the Doctor’s crazy patients that had got
the better of him; so they come runnin’ in
with a long rope, and set in to tie me up
right thar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The plaguey Doctor turned in to help ’em
do it, too. I cussed, and hollered, and kicked
off both boots, and broke two of my teeth
a-grittin’ of ’em, I was so consumin’ mad.
But it was no go; I was a-playin’ a lone hand,
with both bowers and the ace ag’inst me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The fust thing I knew they had me tied
hand and foot, and h’isted into thar greasy old
meat wagon with some dead hogs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘To the lock-up with him,’ shouted the Doctor,
jest bilin’ with rage; ‘he’s crazy as a cow
with her horns knocked off.’ They took me
thar, sure enough, and I staid thar till midnight
before the mistake was known. I was pooty
well scratched up, but that Dr. Tweezer was
the most horrid sight you ever did see.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>ALAS! POOR DOCTOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Arter that fight he looked as though he had
been the subject in a dissectin’ room, with at
least a dozen medical students peelin’ and
hackin’ of him in the interests of science. The
Doctor allowed that the erysipelas would set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in, seein’ thar were so many small veins busted
in his face, so he painted it all over with scarlet
iodine as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He did look like the very old Nick, and no
mistake. His face was fearfully puffed up, you
see, and his nose was knocked clear away round
to one side. His mouth in particular was a
study that a feller couldn’t git familiar with. It
was a problem that the more you looked into
the more your ideas got confused. It was
swelled and twisted and run around, out of all
shape and proportion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He had the terriblest time you ever heard
of gittin’ his victuals into it and fairly started
down his throat. Thar he would sit at the
table explorin’ about for fully five minutes
strivin’ to make the harbor, and when he
couldn’t fetch it, he would draw the spoon back
and look at it a while, plannin’ another expedition.
He knew where his mouth <em>ought</em> to be,
you see, and where it <em>had</em> been a few hours
before, and to be obliged to canvass the whole
of his head to find it, was somethin’ he wasn’t
accustomed to.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It seemed as if he never would git through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>jabbin’ the spoon about his face, and when he
would finally strike the openin’, it would be
away round on one side of his head, so much
so in fact, that a person would think he was
pourin’ the soup into his ear. He would be all
hunkadory then durin’ the remainder of that
meal, but the next time he would come to the
table, the same performance would have to be
gone through with.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He couldn’t keep run of the thing, nohow.
It was here to-day and somewhere else to-morrow,
like a wrinkle in a shirt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The swellin’ kept shiftin’ and undulatin’
about continually, down in one place and up in
another, all within an hour, and that would
shove the mouth away down along the neck
somewhere, or clear across to the other side of
the head, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The family would be sittin’ thar eatin’ no
more than he was, they would be so busily engaged
watchin’ his singular manœuverin’, and
it would make him so roarin’ mad that he would
send ’em all away from the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He tried to eat by the aid of a small lookin’
glass, but that didn’t work any better than goin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>it blind. When he saw how disfigured every
feature was, his appetite would begin to git
away from him pooty lively, and he would sling
the glass into the corner, and fall to denouncin’
me like a crazy bush-whacker.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The yard, too, was a sight; everythin’ in it
was painted and scratched and painted ag’in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old Mrs. Sharron—who was allers a-smellin’
around about butcherin’ time, on the
lookout for a fresh morsel—was gwine by the
Doctor’s the next mornin’, and she noticed the
blood and ha’r a-stickin’ to the chips and pump
handle, and she allowed he had killed his spring
pig, so she dropped in to ask him for the ears
and a piece of the liver.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Doctor thought she was runnin’ him on
his late skirmish, and you never see a man fly
into such a passion in all your born days.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He jumped up and pulled his pizen pump
out of a drawer, and ses he: ‘You old faded
remnant! you scollop! you creasy old cinder of
an incendi’ry fire!’ he contin’ed, jest that way,
‘I’ll gin ye jest seven seconds to git out of my
house in, or I’ll hoist the gizzard out of ye
mi’ty quick!’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“Jehominy! wasn’t she skeered, though?
You never see a cat git from under a stove
quicker when a pot biles over, than she got out
of that house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So Dr. Tweezer didn’t speak very highly of
me, eh? Wal, now you kind o’ know the
reason, don’t ye?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>MY NEIGHBOR WORSTED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>As I look from my window I am surprised at
the change the last half hour has wrought
upon my neighbor and his immediate surroundings.
At that time he emerged from the shed
in which he keeps his extra household furniture,
with a length of stove-pipe and an elbow under
his arms. They were apparently just the things
he needed to tone down the draught of his new
stove, and shoot the sparks clear of the banker’s
eaves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>I think I never saw him look better-natured
than at that moment. His face was clear and
unruffled as a woodland pool. His children
played around him with unsuspecting minds and
unlimited speech. The household cat, with all
confidence in his noble nature, familiarly rubbed
her ribs against his leg, as he for a moment
stood deciding which end of the length to introduce
to the elbow. Even the old hen roosting
on the enclosure seemed to settle her head into
her body with more than ordinary satisfaction as
she regarded the complacent scene beneath her.</p>

<p class='c006'>But half an hour ago all was peace, confidence
and love, and now what a change is
here! I hear the children, but see them not.
Their plaintive wail reminds me how often
laughter is the harbinger of tears. The hen
with ruffled feathers and outstretched neck
stands aloof upon the ridge of a distant dwelling.
The household cat that had grown old in
the family, and had good reason to believe herself
privileged, purrs no more. She has painful
reasons to think otherwise now, as she crouches
in the most retired corner of the premises,
assiduously applying whatever balm her tongue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>affords to injured parts. She doubtless muses
how heavier than an infant’s spoon it is to feel
an adult’s boot.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet my neighbor was neither rash nor hasty.</p>

<p class='c006'>He seemed the embodiment of perseverance,
as he repeatedly offered that length of stove-pipe
an elbow which it, like a prudish maiden, provokingly
refused. Soon the drops of perspiration
began to stand upon his face and neck
in large globes, and I knew that patience was
oozing from every pore. I knew by the scattering
children, the cackling hen, and the flying
household cat, that the “rose-lipped cherubim”
of which the poet sings, were abiding with him
no longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently his wife came to his assistance with
a case-knife, and for a time it seemed as though
victory would crown their united efforts. Reinforcements
turned the tide at Waterloo, and laid
proud France at the mercy of Europe, and how
often the assistance from the mind or arm of a
noble wife rolls back the enemy from the door.
But reinforcements could not mend the matter
here. The poor woman soon retired from the
scene with wounded fingers and damaged pride.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>My neighbor himself has ceased to strive.
Flattened, kicked, and abandoned, the pipes lie
masters of the situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ah! I am fully persuaded that neither depth
of affliction, nor height of impudence, nor length
of trial, nor breadth of argument, nor extravagance,
nor parsimony, nor things in particular,
nor things in general, can begin to compare, as
triers of patience, with a couple of old frill-edged
stove-pipes, that emphatically set their edge
against a union.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A VISIT TO BENICIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>To-day I had occasion to visit Benicia. The
place is situated on the Straits of Carquinez.
Not far from the town the Government Arsenal
and Barracks are situated. And as a striking
proof of the loyal and law-abiding spirit of the
citizens, I may mention the fact, that all the government
property above alluded to is defended
by two soldiers, a corporal—who, by the way,
has a wooden leg—and a high private.</p>

<p class='c006'>While stopping there, I noticed they were
engaged in the pleasurable task of firing a salute
of twenty-one guns, in commemoration of Bunker
Hill. They were having a busy time of it,
for while the wooden-legged corporal was loading
and discharging the cannon, the private was
forwarding the ammunition from the magazine—about
a quarter of a mile distant—in a wheelbarrow.
“If soldiers will do this in time of
peace,” I said to myself, “what would they not
accomplish in time of war?” and I walked away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>from the spot, congratulating myself for having
invested in Government bonds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The town, in all likelihood, would never have
been heard of outside of the State of California,
had it not been for the brave “Benicia Boy.”
Here it was that he swung the blacksmith’s
heavy sledge, and practiced the first rudiments
of the pugilistic profession, which subsequently
gained him his world-wide notoriety.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many of the citizens are yet pointed out to
the visitor as parties who at some period of their
life served as a sand bag on which the muscular
“Boy” hardened his knuckles.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I gazed upon the scattered village,—for it
is no more,—I mused, how a man should come
forth from such a paltry place to “awe” the
world. For as Goliath challenged the hosts of
Israel, so came the brave “Benicia Boy” and
dared creation’s millions.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as the youthful shepherd, afterwards
king, rose up and smote the overweening giant
with a stone, till all his brain oozed forth, so from
Albion’s Isle a youthful “King,” smote the western
champion in the midriff with his mawley,
and all his wind gushed out!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>ONE OF HEENAN’S MEMENTOES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After searching some time to discover the
blacksmith shop where the pugilist used to work,
I learned that it was long since torn down and
a church now occupied the site. But an old
gentleman who kept a small boarding house,
conducted me to an ancient pump, at which he
said the “Boy” on several occasions bathed his
nose after having a bout with some person who
didn’t let him have things all his own way, and
there I wept my tears of tribute.</p>

<p class='c006'>A large iron-bound boot-jack, set in a glass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>case, was shown to me by a saloon-keeper. He
assured me, with this weapon the “Boy” had
killed several cats belonging to the neighbors
which had disturbed his slumbers. This boot-jack
had also caused the death of a mule, for on
one occasion the pugilist hurled it with such
violence at a cat that was scampering across
the roof of a shed that the heavy missile went
through the boards. A farmer’s mule that was
standing inside received the weapon behind the
ear, and immediately went to gravel as though
he had been felled with a sledge-hammer. The
farmer instituted a suit against the “Boy” to
recover damages, but the friends of the pugilist
made up a purse to satisfy the demand of the
farmer, and the matter was hushed.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was also shown a jagged hole in a high
board fence, which, it is said, the “Boy” made
one night while going home from a neighboring
saloon.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems he had some trouble with a companion
before leaving the saloon, and seeing his
shadow dogging his steps, mistook it for the
substance of his late antagonist; very naturally
presuming that his intentions were anything but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>friendly, he turned hastily around and dissipated
the obnoxious shadow by knocking it about fifteen
feet into the garden.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p294.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A SCIENTIFIC OPENING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>The fence rattled and shook around the whole
lot under the terrible blow. He made a hole in
the boards through which a large goat could
readily jump without sacrificing any of its hair
by the performance, and permanently injured
a good-sized pear tree that stood inside the
enclosure, about three feet distant. The concussion
was terrible. A couple of turkeys that
happened to be roosting in the tree at the time
dropped from their limb as though shot through
the head with a needle-gun. Never afterwards
could they be induced to roost upon anything
further from the ground than the cross-bar
of a saw-horse or the handles of a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>No doubt the town at one time had great
expectations, as it formerly was the capital of
the State. It is now a capital joke to see a
person undertaking to walk through the town
in the winter season, without faith strong
enough or feet broad enough to support him
upon the surface of the oceans of mud he will
find himself gazing wistfully across.</p>

<p class='c006'>On my way down a man was pointed out to
me on the boat who is said to be the meanest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>man in his county. My informant assured me
that when the mean individual’s wife died last
year, he borrowed a pair of forceps from the
dentist at Benicia, and extracted all her gold-filled
teeth. And on the morning prior to
her funeral he sat upon the door-step, hammer
in hand, with a flat-iron upon his knees, cracking
the teeth like English walnuts, and with a
sewing awl extracting the filling from the
cavities.</p>

<p class='c006'>During my journey I didn’t cultivate that
man’s acquaintance. He is a person to stand
away from, especially when clouds are charged
with electricity.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>TOO MUCH OF INDIAN.</h2>
</div>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Take away the dish; I have had my fill
of Modoc; have had buck for breakfast,
squaw for dinner, and papoose for supper, until
at the very name of Indian my appetite forsakes
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appellations that for a season fell upon
my ears, like a new poem from the lips of some
sweet bard, have poetry for me no longer. The
names, “Captain Jack,” “Scarfaced Charlie,”
“Shacknasty Jim,” “Rain-in-the-face,” “Old-man-afraid-of-his-horse,”
“Sitting Bull,” or “Ellen’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Man,” have lost their charm. They have become
dull and uninteresting, and I would hear them
no more forever. I have been duped, deceived,
defrauded, on account of these rascally Indians.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have gazed in silent awe upon what I supposed
to be the scalp of no less a personage
than “Old Sconchin,” and it now transpires that
the redoubtable old chief turns up among the
Indians recently captured.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh! Oh! how this world is given to lying!</p>

<p class='c006'>I have journeyed long and far, by water and
by rail, on horseback and on foot, and purchased
at an extravagant price an Indian’s scalp which
the seller under oath, with lifted hand, assured
me was the veritable crown lock of that same
“Old Sconchin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With tears coursing down his sunburned
cheeks he informed me, that with his own eyes,
in the full light of day, he saw it plucked smoking
from the sconce of the expiring brave.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have consequently braided watch chains of
the hair, fashioned a money purse of the skin,
and then withdrawn into a private apartment to
shed bitter tears of sorrow, because the material
didn’t quite hold out to make a tobacco pouch.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>And now the distressing intelligence reaches
me that the renowned “Old Sconchin” stands
manacled in the camp of his foemen, with an
unscarified top and as luxuriant hair as ever
drew nourishment from an Indian head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh! where shall we turn, or where shall we
look for honesty, since it is not found in the
breast of the Indian scalp peddler?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>GOING UP THE SPOUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Rats and mice, like ourselves, often labor at
a great disadvantage while endeavoring to
make a livelihood. They often make a miss of
it altogether by not knowing the proper time to
set out upon an expedition. Their life is a perpetual
skirmish. They have to take chances
and be upon their guard continually. Their
mortal enemy and dread, the cat, may be asleep
in the fourth story, and the poor mouse knows
not of it as he looks wistfully across the intervening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>space between the ash barrel and the
basement stairs; but after weighing the chances
of escape or capture, he scurries across the
opening with as much haste as though the sharp
claws of pussy were raking the stunted fur from
his wiry tail.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sun may pour down its genial rays and
the planks which his way lies over be warm and
inviting, but he cannot loiter to enjoy its warmth
or survey the beauties of nature. Oh! who
would be a mouse? sigh I, as I sit and ponder
over his life of inherent fear and uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c006'>He seems to have no confidence in himself.
His actions are like those of an inferior checker
player. Shove about as he may, the chances
are he will soon regret the manœuvre, and wish
himself safely back again at the starting point.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/p300.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Everything about the premises seems to be
after him. He regards the old blacking-brush
that lies under the bench with looks of suspicion
for hours together, and dare not risk a scamper
past. He takes it for a
horrid cat, quietly and
patiently biding her time.
He retires into his hole and waits fully an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>before peeping out again; but there it sits to
blast his sight and cause a cold thrill to run
along his little spine. The fact that it does not
change its position does not in the least weaken
his mistrust; on the contrary, it rather strengthens
it. “It is so cat-like,” he says to himself,
“for it to be sitting there motionless.” In the
handle projecting from one end he very naturally
thinks he recognizes the tail, and at this
new discovery he backs into his hole again in
great trepidation.</p>

<p class='c006'>He feels certain now that he was right in his
suspicions. Another wait follows. On again
emerging, there it lies as before; and if that
mouse was profane, and had a soul to hazard, it
would undoubtedly hazard it, and roundly berate
that brush through compressed teeth.</p>

<p class='c006'>It takes but little to set a poor mouse into a
perfect fluster. Down rolls a stick of wood
from the pile, and Mr. Mouse, nibbling at the
other corner of the shed, jumps at least eight
feet in the direction of his hole. The wind
blows down the clothes-line stick, and simultaneous
with its fall upon the planks the heart,
liver and lights of the poor mouse seem to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>running a steeple-chase to see which can jump
from his mouth first. Away he scurries across
the yard, so fast, that though your eyes were
endeavoring to keep up with him all the way,
you merely know <em>something</em> has been moving,
but can only surmise what.</p>

<p class='c006'>We sometimes think the trials and disappointments
of humanity are great, but dear me!
what are they compared to the miseries of these
poor creatures. From their hardships deliver
me! For all their care and caution, they do so
often miscalculate. This is evidenced by the
number of times our old cat enters the house
with her mouth full, and her eyes sparkling with
pride.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is nothing so very degrading or humiliating
in a cat’s life, and the thought of becoming
a cat does not make one shudder as does the
thought of becoming a mouse. A good household
cat does not occupy such a very bad position
in life after all; by <em>good</em> I mean an excellent
mouser, one never guilty of letting a mouse
escape after having the second wipe at him; no
scraggy creature with stove-singed back and
scolloped ears, but a well-behaved, home-loving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>animal. The lot of such a creature is preferable
to that of some men whom I have met in
life, that is, if there were no rude children in
the house. There is always some drawback; a
cat is peculiarly blessed that lives in a house
where there are no children; it seems to be
counted as one of the family almost, and its life,
though short, is certainly a happy one. But
ah! these reckless children, that snatch up
Tommy by the tail as they would a sauce-pan,
and as though the tail was actually intended for
a handle. On second thought, the life of a cat
is not so very pleasant after all.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the last half hour I have been deeply
interested in the manœuvres of a large rat in
the yard of an adjacent house. He has made
three unsuccessful attempts to go up the sink-spout.
Thrice has he glided up the slippery
incline until the tip of his long tail disappeared
from view, but as often has he beat a hasty
retreat, assisted on his downward way by a
rushing torrent of hot dish-water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
<img src='images/p304.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>ON A RAID.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He is a determined fellow, however, and
sticks to an enterprise with the spirit and pertinacity
of a world-seeking Columbus, or a prison-breaking Monte Christo. No doubt the hungry
edge of appetite is whetted by the strong effluvium
arising from Limburger cheese (the people
are Germans) that fills the whole atmosphere
with an odor truly agreeable to the rodent nose,
every time the pantry door is opened. The
cheese has been lately stirred up, I presume, by
the trenchant knife of Pater-familias, and consequently
the poor hunger-pinched rat is allured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>up the spout at this inopportune hour, while the
servant girl is washing the dishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every living creature has its weakness. The
horse whinnies when the oats draw nigh, and
forgets the galling collar. Sheep, that at other
times will not come within gunshot, grow tame
and unsuspicious when the salt is shaken in the
pan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hog has a penchant for clover-roots, or
wherefore does the rusted wire ring ornament
his nose? Is it there because it is the fashion?
Ask the farmer.</p>

<p class='c006'>And undoubtedly cheese is the weakness of
the rat family. It is their aim, and often their
end, too. It is the shrine to bow down before
which the rat will jeopardize his life every hour
of the twenty-four.</p>

<p class='c006'>He dreams of it. In his fitful slumbers he
beholds it ranged around him tier on tier, as in
a great store room, and not a cat within forty
leagues. He is in the rat’s Paradise, and happy.
No deceptive poisons that consume the stomach,
no insidious, subtle traps, yawning ready to
clutch the unsuspecting victim, surround him.
He is safe and at peace, and would dwell there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>forever and forever in one unbroken endless
night. But the heavy rumbling of a dray startles
him, for all sweet dreams have their wakings,
alas! that it is so! He wakes, and where is he?
Under the wet sidewalk, drenched and tousled
with the drippings of the day’s rain, with nothing
for breakfast but a dry onion peel, the prog of
the previous night, which nothing but a forty-eight
hours’ fast could induce him to seize. Ah,
me! what chances the fellow has to take in order
to secure sufficient sustenance to keep life and
body together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honor pricks me on,” soliloquized old Sir
John, on the field of Shrewsbury, when he withdrew
from the general clash and rendering up
of souls, to breathe a spell, and moralize upon
the insignificance of Fame, or Honor, as against
the value of life. But nothing pricks on the poor
rat but his craving little digestive organs. The
mill is crying out for grists, the hopper is empty,
the stone still turning, and something must be
done, and that quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>No honor is attached to the expedition, and
even though he should succeed in making the
“inning,” which is doubtful, all that can be said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>is that he has “gone up the spout,” and in the
common acceptation of the saying, that is certainly
nothing to be very highly elated over.</p>

<p class='c006'>I actually feel ashamed when I think of the
many projects I have abandoned through life,
because I met with slight reverses. Here before
me is this poor water-soaked rat, his hair still
smoking from his recent scald, emerging once
more from behind the wood box, determined to
solve the problem of the sink-spout or perish in
the attempt. A grim smile of resolution seems
to part his pointed features, as he moves quietly
up to the dripping conduit from which he lately
scampered with steaming ribs.</p>

<p class='c006'>They may talk of deeds of noble daring, of
vaulting the breach, or traversing the wild; but
for sterling courage, for indomitable perseverance
and pluck, commend me to this little
adventurer in my neighbor’s yard. In the face
of three scalding inundations, he ventures again
upon the expedition, unshaken, unsubdued, unterrified.
He takes more chances and subjects
himself to more risks in ascending that spout
than old Samuel de Champlain in exploring up
the St. Lawrence among the Iroquois.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>What if the large flea-pasturing dog lying
indolently in the yard would rouse from the
lethargic sleep that holds him, and for once
make himself useful by thrusting his bristling
muzzle up the orifice after the little explorer,
thereby cutting off retreat in the event of another
disastrous deluge? The terrible result of such
an action on the part of the dog is too painful
and improbable to contemplate.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>JIM DUDLEY’S SERMON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Hereafter I shall have no faith in reports.
Last week I heard that Jim Dudley had
left the city, and was congratulating myself on
at last escaping him. But my congratulations
were premature. Last night he called upon
me, and kept me in torture for fully two hours;
at a time, too, when I should have been asleep.
But what cared he for that? The scoundrel!
there was no shaking him off. He sticks to a
person like mortar to a brick. I had to sit and
listen, though I do honestly believe every word
the fellow uttered was an unqualified lie; but
he swears to its truth, and how can I prove it
otherwise. It is better to take it as it comes
and ask no questions for conscience’ sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never told you about the sermon I preached
over in Misertown one Sunday. I had a time
of it thar and no mistake. Hold on a minute
and I’ll tell you how it was.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“You see, Gil Bizby—that plaguey shirk, I
never mention his name but what I feel like
trouncin’ of him—but he was a genius though
and no foolin’ about it, a natural born inventor,
chock full of notions as a toy shop.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p314.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SOMETHING NEW.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“But somehow or another he never could
bring anythin’ to a payin’ focus. Allers whittlin’
and borin’ and plannin’ around though.
Wherever you’d meet him he’d be haulin’ out
of his pocket some old drawin’, with more
wheels and contrivances pictured out on it than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>you could think of in a twelve hours’ dream.
He never could git the cap sheaf onto his
endeavor though. Allers somethin’ amiss; a
wheel too many, or another one wantin’, or too
many cogs to have the thing work just right.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He invented a contrivance for pluckin’
chickens.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was a rustler. He shoved the fowls
through a machine somethin’ like a corn sheller,
an gin ’em an electric shock while passin’
along, and shot ’em out of a spout at t’other
end of the machine as bare as weavers’ shuttles.
He didn’t make anythin’ out of it though.
He had to chuck ’em through while alive, you
see, and that clashed with the law. When he
took the machine down to the city to introduce
it to the pultry dealers, the society fellers who
look out for the interests of dumb critters got
arter him and sewed him up. They put a reef
in his jib pooty quick now, I tell you.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They were passin’ along through the market
one day, and they saw Gil just a humpin’
himself showin’ off the apparatus to the market
men. He was crankin’ and pumpin’ away, like
a sailor when there’s fifteen feet of water in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>hold and still rizin, and the chickens were a
screamin’ and a scootin’ through the contrivance,
close as if they were run on a string
head ag’inst tail, and just a cloud of feathers
hoverin’ around over it. Didn’t they fasten on
to that Gil Bizby though? They snatched him
up quicker than if he had been hoss-stealin’,
and confiscated his plucker, and tucked an
alfired heavy fine onto him besides.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Meetin’ with such poor encouragement in
that direction he went back to Sculleyville, and
set out to invent a thunderin’ great machine for
layin’ cobble-stones. That was just him all
over; allers startin’ in to git up some outlandish
lookin’ thing. This machine was a crusher and
no gettin’ ‘round it. It was fearful enough to
make a cow slip her cud, I’ll be shot if it wasn’t.
It looked somethin’ like Noah’s ark set on
wheels and filled with all kinds of machinery.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He started in to experiment one moonlight
night in front of the court house, but got the
main belt crossed or somethin’, I disremember
just what, and Jerusalem! in less than ten
minutes he ran the whole population out to the
foot-hills in thar night clothes. There wasn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>no stoppin’ the consarned thing. Poor Gil was
knocked senseless at the first revolution, and
nobody else knowed how to control it. It rolled
the whole length of the square, tearin’ up the
stones it had pounded down the day before and
sendin’ of ’em buzzin’ over the village in all
directions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No home was sacred, and no head was safe,
as the poet has it. Poor old Mrs. Scooley lived
just long enough to learn this, and no longer.
She was goin’ once too often to git her pitcher
filled at the corner grocery that night, and a
stone took her in the small of the back as she
was enterin’ the door, and it h’isted her clear
over the counter on top of a barrel; it’s true
as I’m tellin’ it to you. Poor old body; she
was the pioneer female of the village too. The
first woman to wash a shirt in Sculleyville.
But arter all, the town wasn’t much loser by
her passin’ away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She was a sort of panicky old critter anyhow,
always scary about catchin’ the smallpox
or any other prevailin’ disease that come around.
The old village physician said he would ruther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>see the very old scratch makin’ towards him on
the street than old Mrs. Scooley.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE DOCTOR’S SCOURGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Comin’ from church or market, as the case
might be, she would fasten on to him like a
wood-tick to a leaf, and he couldn’t git rid of
her nohow. She would have him time her pulse
right thar on the sidewalk; and be a shovin’ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>her tongue out for his inspection. And she
did have such an unlimited, wallopin’ great
tongue too; it seemed when she was shovin’ all<a id='t319'></a>
of it out, as though she was actewelly disgorgin’
her liver. It’s so, by Jingo! People would be
a stoppin’ and standin’ thar, wonderin’ what
was the matter with the old gal—that is, people
that didn’t know her peculiarities; though most
everybody in the village had seen her standin’
in that position so often, that they would be
more surprised to see her with her tongue in
her mouth than projectin’ out in the rain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The old Doctor used to be terribly annoyed.
He would say, kind of hurriedly like, because
he would be itchin’ to git away from her:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Oh! you’re all right I reckon, Mrs.
Scooley; but you had better be a gittin’ along
home, and not stand too long in the cold air,
with so much of your vital organs exposed to
the weather; the result may be fearful if not
fatal!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would ginnerally start her off pooty
lively towards her shanty. They say the first
time the Doctor saw her tongue he was surprised
so much that he looked actewelly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>skeered. Says he: ‘I’ve been nigh unto eight
and thirty years a practicin’ physician, and until
this moment I flattered myself that I was
familiar with all the ins and outs of the profession.
But I begin to think I gin over the
dissectin’ knife too soon, for here’s somethin’
that I was not prepared for.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that’s not tellin’ you about the sermon,
is it? but when I mentioned that Gil Bizby, I
sort of wandered off arter him and his contrivances.
Wal, as I was about to tell you, Gil
and I were saunterin’ around Misertown one
Sunday, and we saw any number of gals goin’
into the school-house where the preachin’ was
carried on. So we concluded to step in and
git a better look at some of ’em. I didn’t
know many of the people round thar, but from
what I heard I judged they were the meanest,
close-fistedest set of sinners that ever had the
gospel dispensed with amongst ’em.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I understood they had treated their minister
plaguey mean when he fust come thar to look
arter them. Thar was no regular place for
him to stop, you see, and they agreed amongst
themselves to take turns a keepin’ him until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>they could get a house up for him. He was
one of those young, easy, green kind of fellers
that had seemin’ly never been so far away from
home before but what he could see the smoke
of his father’s chimney, or smell his mother’s
corn-dodgers burnin’. And they soon took
advantage of it, and sort of played button with
him, shovin’ him around from one to another as
though he was too hot to hold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He fust went to a feller by the name of
Wigglewort. Ses Wig, ‘I’m really very sorry,
Mr. Sermonslice, but we unfortunately have no
accommodations for you at present. We have
no place for you to sleep ’thout we put you in the
barn, and the nights are ruther cold for that,
besides the rats might annoy you. Sorry you
happened to come just at this time, of all others
the most embarrassin’. It’s not but what I
would like to have you stop with us; I would
indeed, Mr. Sermonslice, consider it an honor
to have you.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The minister, takin’ his books under his
arm, started out into the night as though his
life depended upon the most prompt kind of
action. He wasn’t within hailin’ inside of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>minutes. He went over and succeeded in
gettin’ lodgin’s with a feller named Joe Grimsby,
who lived over by Frog Marsh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Joe was too derned lazy to do his own
prayin’, and while the parson stopped with him
he got rid of it. They do say he was the laziest
old curmudgeon that ever turned up his
eyes. He used to say a praar at the beginnin’
of the month, and on the followin’ nights he
would always allude to it in a sort of matter-offact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>way. ‘You know my feelin’s towards ye.
Nothin’ hid from ye I reckon. I haven’t changed
my sentiments yet. If I do I’ll let ye know of
it. I’ll keep nothin’ back from you, though it
should take the har off.’ He would go on in
that business-like way, and the hul time be
a crawlin’ into bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wal, as I was goin’ to tell you, Gil and I
poked into the buildin’, and sat down thar
amongst the congregation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The minister hadn’t come yet, and pooty
soon an old feller got up, and ses he, ‘It may
be the minister has had a late breakfast and
will not git here for some time yet. In the
meantime, as it’s a dry season and our crops
need a shower of rain, we mout as well have a
little prayin’ goin’ on. We can’t do much harm
anyhow, and we may be the means of bringin’
down a good smart shower that will be money
in our pockets in the long run.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“He asked several to take hold and do somethin’
in that way, but one had a cold, and
another one was just gettin’ over the mumps.
And so on they went makin’ excuses. Finally
the old feller turned to me, and ses he: ‘Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span><em>you</em> would lead us, you look like one who
has had some experience that way.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thanked him for the compliment, but told
him I was somethin’ like the officers in the army—I
would ruther foller than lead. But he stuck
to me like a Jew to a customer. Arter a while
I consented, and jest as I was about startin’ in,
a feller come in and said the minister had got a
terrible ticklin’ in his throat caused by partly
swallowin’ a har in the butter over to old Joe
Grimsby’s, and couldn’t attend to his duties that
day. So the old chap got up ag’in, and ses:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘We won’t have any preachin’ then, without
some person present will volunteer to act in
our pastor’s place this mornin’.’ But no one
spoke up. ‘Perhaps,’ he ses, turnin’ to me,
‘you would favor us by conductin’ the service,
young man. You doubtless are competent to
perform that duty.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“This sort of got me. Then the thought
struck me perhaps I’d make somethin’ out of
’em by it. Besides didn’t want to plead ignorance
right thar amongst ’em, so gettin’ up, I
ses: ‘This is somewhat unexpected. Honors
foller one another pooty fast.’ With that I got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>into the pulpit and began to look down at ’em
pooty seriously. Thar was no Bible on the
desk, so I asked if thar was any person that
would loan me one for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some of ’em spoke up and said they had
books, but were in the habit of keepin’ em to
foller along arter the minister, and correct him
when he made a mistake. Besides they liked
to see how he worked out the text. I looked
at ’em some time pooty hard. I thought they
beat anythin’ I had come across for some time,
and I had a good mind to git down ag’in, only
I allowed they’d laugh at me. So I ses, ‘all
right. You can keep your books. I reckon I
know enough by heart to git along with.’ I then
gin out somethin’ for them to sing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Short or long meter?’ inquired the leader
of the singers, who were settin’ over in the
corner. I didn’t exactly understand him. As I
knowed he was in the habit of meetin’ Sal Clippercut
over to Mrs. Curry’s every Sunday
afternoon, I allowed he was askin’ for somethin’
shorter, as he was longin’ to meet her. I spoke
up pooty sharp, and ses, ‘You will please sing
what I gin you to sing. I reckon you aren’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>longin’ to meet her so bad but what you can
wait until arter the service is over. She’ll keep
that long, I reckon, without spilin’. I know her.
She isn’t none of your Spring chickens nuther,’
I contin’ed, just like that, and you ought to have
seen the way he looked; and the gals commenced
to snicker and crowd thar handkerchiefs
into thar mouths.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One little red-faced critter that sat alongside
of him tittered right out. Her mother who was
sittin’ near by jumped up and ses: ‘Becky Jane,
you go right straight hum this minute, and go
to peelin’ the ‘taters for dinner.’ But a feller
who looked as though his mother had been a
mullator, or even somethin’ of a darker shade,
got up and ses:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The gal isn’t to blame in the least. It’s
that feller in the pulpit thar. I for one don’t
want to hear any more of his lingo.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, then, you can stuff wool in your ears,’
I ses, ‘and you won’t have far to go to get it
nuther,’ I contin’ed, just that way, alludin’ to his
own har, which seemed pooty woolly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You ought to see how they looked, fust at
him, then at me. He colored up, I reckon, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>he was too black to show it. I heard him grit
his teeth from whar I was standin’. He didn’t
say any more, but an old woman who was settin’
near jumped up, and ses she:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The meetin’-house is turned into a thayeter!
When a muntybank gets into the pulpit
it is high time for respectable people to be
movin’. I’ll leave!’ she exclaimed, pullin’ her
shawl around her shoulders and beginnin’ to
bustle out of her seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, ye kin go!’ I hollered, jest that way,
for I was beginnin’ to git sort of riled at the
way things war a goin’. When I’m talkin’ politics
or arguin’ over the merits of whisky, I can
bear crossin’ and any amount of contradiction.
But right thar, where a feller had to be choice
of his language, it was different business. ‘Ye
kin go,’ I ses. ‘We kin git along without you,
I reckon. We’re willin’ to chance it, anyhow.
Take your knittin’ along; don’t leave that behind,’
I contin’ed, pointin’ to the seat as though
I saw it lyin’ thar. I didn’t though, but I wanted
to give her a mi’ty hard rub, for I suspected her
piety was put on, and that she was displeased
because nobody was noticin’ her new bonnet.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“The hul congregation took it for granted
that the knittin’ <em>was</em> thar, and you ought to
have seen ’em stretchin’ and cranin’ out thar
necks as far as they could to get a look into
the pew.</p>

<p>TRUTH IS POWERFUL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One old feller that was settin’ back pooty
far, craned out kind of quarterin’ ruther suddenly
and his neck gin a crack like a bon bon.
He commenced oh! ohin’ and tryin’ to git it
back to its old position ag’in, but he couldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>make any headway until his wife went to rubbin’
and chafin’ of it, right thar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that old woman, whew! She was as
mad as a wet hen. She couldn’t hardly find
the door, she was so mixed up. When she
finally got thar she turned round and straightenin’
of herself up she ses, ‘Young man!’—Before
she got any further I broke in on her,
for I judged she had a tongue that was hung in
the middle. So I ses, ‘That’ll do, that’ll do,
Mrs. You kin move along. You’re disturbin’
the peace of the congregation, and besides
all that you’re showin’ your false teeth mi’ty bad
in the bargain.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“She got out arter that pooty lively, now I
can tell you. I could see her as she went up
the road towards her home, and two or three
times she stopped and turnin’ around acted as
though she had half a mind to come back and
try the hul thing over ag’in. But arter standin’
thar a while thinkin’ like a pig when it’s listenin’
to the grass takin’ root, she would shake her
head and move along up the turnpike as though
she concluded she had enough of that kind of
pie.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“This piece of performance sort of throwed
me off the track. While I was standin’ thar
thinkin’ where to start in with the discourse, Gil
Bizby come a crawfishin’ up the steps to one
side of me and whisperin’ ses, ‘I say, Jim, you
haven’t got to chock blocks already, have ye?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No,’ I answered, ‘I ain’t got to chock
blocks, but I’ve got the ropes twisted around
and things look ginnerally mixed jist now, I can
tell ye.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wall, start in on the sermon at once then,’
he urged, ‘for they are gettin’ mi’ty impatient
now I can tell you. You’ve got to be doin’
<em>somethin’</em> pooty quick. But whatever you do,’
he contin’ed, ‘don’t git up very high without
havin’ some idea how you are goin’ to git down
ag’in. Keep steerin’ around waters that you’ve
piloted over before. Remember a blind mouse
shouldn’t venture very far from its hole, especially
if thar’s a whole generation of cats
watchin’ of it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“With that he backed down to his seat ag’in,
and took out his pencil and began to design a
machine for pickin’ the bones out of fish, on
the fly-leaf of a book that was lyin’ thar. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>I started in on the sermon. It wasn’t much of
a sermon, to be sure. It was more like a
lectur’. I couldn’t think of any passages of
scriptur’ just then, so I gin ’em the line from
the philosopher, ‘Why does the frightened dog
depress his tail when he runneth?’</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“You ought to have seen ’em rustlin’ and
turnin’ the leaves, huntin’ to find the passage.
One old feller by the name of Spudd commenced
to paw over the pages, and his wife ses,
‘Don’t go that way; turn back to the Book of
Job.’ He looked round at her with his under
lip stickin’ out jest that way, arter wettin’ of his
thumb to start turnin’ over ag’in, and ses, ‘Job
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>be biled and buttered! I kin pick old Solomon
from amongst a thousand of ’em. He was
sound on the goose, he was.’</p>

<p>THE OLD INTERROGATOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>“Two or three of ’em started in to ask me
where the text was located, but I kept on talkin’
right straight along, lookin’ around to all of
’em at once and no one in particular. I didn’t
gin ’em a chance to stop me ag’in, or git a
word in edgeways. One singular-lookin’ old
coon with a weed on his hat got up and stood
signalin’ of me, and waitin’ and watchin’ for a
chance to ask me somethin’. But I never let
on to see him. I reckon he stood thar five
minutes with his finger up pointin’ to attract
my attention, and his mouth open so wide, that
from my elevated position I could tell what he
had swallowed for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I gin ’em a sort of ramblin’ discourse,
alludin’ to the prevailin’ passions, and errors of
the age. Amongst other things I touched on
jealousy a little,—I wanted to stir ’em up a
trifle on that subject, because there was a great
deal of jealousy in that neighborhood. The
green-eyed monster was a-rantin’ and a-ravin’
round in a good many households, and as it
ginnerally turns out, there was least cause for it
where it was most prevailin’. One old feller
was moved by the first remark. When I said—quotin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>from the poet—‘Jealousy in the wife
is wuss than trichina in the pork,’ he leaned
over to the man settin’ in the next pew and ses,
‘I can’t tell you for the life of me whar he gits
the passage, but it’s the solid truth, anyhow.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I went on and finished the sermon, or
lectur’ ruther, and then I ses, ‘The choir will
please sing the hymn beginnin’ “Give, give,
give to the needy,” arter which I will pass
around amongst the congregation and take up
a collection for the benefit of the heathen in
furrin parts.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Je-whitteker! You ought to have seen ’em
turn around and look at each other when I said
that. I can’t describe it to you. I can’t do the
scene justiss. If I had told ’em I was goin’ to
stay with them through the season, I could
hardly have started ’em to thinkin’ any more
than I did by tellin’ ’em about that collection
for the heathen in furrin parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arter two or three attempts the singin’
began. I closed my eyes, and leanin’ back in
my chair minister-like, commenced to estimate
the probable yield of each pew. While I was
thinkin’ thar, and cal’latin’ how much I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>make by the preachin’ business, I noticed the
singin’ dyin’ out, and a dyin’ out slowly like, as
the prisoner said his hopes were when the
sheriff was a-fumblin’ around his neck adjustin’
the rope. So I opened my eyes easy like, as
though comin’ back to earthly scenes reluctantly,
and you can water my whiskey if I wasn’t just
in time to see ole Ned Scullet’s coat-tails
whiskin’ around the door jamb, the hindmost
rag of the congregation. Women and children
and all were gone sure enough. On lookin’
out of the winder I see ’em a-scatterin’ and a-hustlin’
and elbowin’ themselves ahead of each
other along the turnpike, as though thar was
great danger in bein’ left behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you believe it, thar was that plaguey
shirk Gil Bizby a-cranin’ up the hill a-leadin’
the crowd. I sat thar a while lookin’ after ’em
and then, comin’ down I began to look around
a little, and pooty soon I noticed that several
of ’em left thar hats, they were in such a hurry
to git out. So I selected a good one, only ’twas
a little out of fashion, and puttin’ it on I ses to
myself, ‘If you think I’m interested enough in
your welfare here or hereafter to preach to you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>for nothin’, you’re mistaken, I reckon.’ With that
I walked out, but not until I had kicked the
remainin’ hats around the room pooty lively.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The next day I noticed an old feller with a
dilapidated beaver on, that looked as if it had
done duty on a scarecrow for several seasons,
sidlin’ up to me, and circlin’ around two or
three times lookin’ mi’ty close at my tile. I’ll
allers think it was his stove-pipe, but he was
too much ashamed to come right out and lay
claim to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that Gil Bizby! I didn’t wonder so much
at the congregation dustin’, arter all, cause they
didn’t know me, but <em>he</em>!—well, no matter, I’ll
git even on him yet.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE POISONED PET.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>It was my good fortune the other day to attend
a picnic in the country. A lady friend insisted
on tacking her pet boy to me on that
occasion. As she couldn’t go herself she wanted
me to have an eye to “sonney,” and see that
he didn’t come in contact with poison-oak. She
assured me he was a good boy and would mind
me as if I was his father! I didn’t pine for the
pet’s company, but could not very well refuse
her request. So he went with me.</p>

<p class='c006'>I very soon found out he was one of those
smart children, who, by a strange freak of nature,
are placed in possession of an impudence that
prompts them to believe they know more at the
age of eight than your average adult.</p>

<p class='c006'>My will and his wishes soon clashed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the thought entered my head that his
mother misrepresented “sonney’s” obedient
nature. “If this is the obedience that an offspring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>manifests to a father,” I mentally murmured,
“it were better to be destitute of the
offspring.” The boy sauced me. He even went
so far as to call me names anything but flattering,
while I was sitting in the presence of a
young lady I most ardently adored. “Go on,
sonney!” I said to myself savagely, “go on,
precocious youth, there are no raging bears in
this suburban park to tear the flesh from the
bones of mouthy children who ‘sauce’ their
betters, as did the animals in the days of
prophets; but nature in other ways has made
provision for such as you, and has sprinkled a
few shrubs around here that can pile the flesh
on to a person’s bones to an alarming degree,
if they get a fair chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After that I paid no attention to him. He ran
at will, browsed through the vines like a hungry
deer, and burrowed into the very heart of
the poison-oak and ivy, with as little fear as a
quail retiring to roost. He enjoyed himself
immensely; so he informed me in the evening.
I am glad he did, for he is having a quiet time
of it now. I saw him this morning, and his face
was as full of expression as a Christmas pudding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>new rolled from the cloth. I think my lady
friend will not be over-anxious to appoint me
guardian over her dutiful son at another picnic.
In the interests of art I have made a sketch of
“sonney” as he appeared this morning, striving
to recognize me by my voice, which he failed to
do, however, being deaf as he was blind.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SEEKING FOR A WIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>And it came to pass about the year one thousand
eight hundred and seventy-three,
being in the autumn, when the new wine was
oozing from the press, and the corn was hardening
in the crib, a bachelor, a farmer of great
possessions, dwelling in the valley of Berryessa,
bent above his resting plow, and thus
communed with himself:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“My stacks are builded, my wine is dripping
from the press, the ripe ears are garnered in
my cribs, my flocks and herds feed fat upon the
hills; and yet, because of my loneliness, am I
unhappy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will arise at eve and repair to my neighbor’s
cottage. Peradventure the aged widow
of the murdered gypsy can counsel me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So when the evening hour was come, the
farmer arose and sought the aged widow’s
abode.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>And as he drew nigh to the cottage, he lifted
up his eyes and, behold! the crone sat upon
her door-step.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE CRONE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And when the dame looked upon the farmer
she knew his heart was troubled; but she knew
not the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>So, lifting up her voice she cried, inquiringly:
“What aileth my neighbor? Has aught befel
thy goods? Has bruin descended from the
mountains to worry thy flocks? Or, are thy
stacks consumed? that thus you droop your
eyelids to the path, and move as by a hearse.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the farmer, drawing nigh, replied: “My
flocks unharmed graze sleek upon the hills; my
stacks stand unconsumed; yet is my spirit
heavy, because my walks are lonely and my
heart is sad, and I come as one seeking counsel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then answered the dame reprovingly: “Out
upon thee, for a fusty, dreamy bachelor! Go
take to thyself a wife; then will thy walks be
no more lonely, neither will thy heart be sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But he, answering her sorrowfully, said:
“Mock me not, good madam, but look with
pitying eyes upon me, and hearken to my voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Behold I am now well stricken in years, my
body is stooping to the grave, my manners, like
my hands, are rough; my blood, like my hair,
is thin; and my teeth but shine in memories of
the past.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How, then, can I win maidens’ hearts?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Alas! on the contrary, they would giggling flee
from before me; no hope for me remains; if I
would wed, I needs must wed a squaw!” And
his countenance fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then was the crone exceedingly displeased,
because he said, “I needs must wed a squaw,”
and she answered him derisively, saying:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go to! Ye speak as with the beak of a
parrot, and with the understanding of a babe!
Are ye studied in books and know not the
proverb, ‘A golden snare will catch the wildest
hare?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not your stacks dot the vale below like
an Egyptian camp? Are not your tanks brimming
with wine and your cribs grinning with
corn?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not your cattle graze upon an hundred
hills? and your industrious laborers follow in
the furrow? And are ye still afeared? Oh,
ye of doubting mind!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go, get thee to thy chest and take to thyself
suitable coin, and hasten to that great city
by the sea—whose churches point to heaven,
but whose people bow to gold.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“There sojourn for a season, and make
no delay in adorning thyself with precious
stones.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Put diamonds upon thy bosom and rings
upon thy fingers, and be zealous to stand in
the hall-ways and in the market-places, and in
the houses of exchange.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seek to be observed of the people, and
take heed that ye look upon all men as being
thy servants.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And let thy wealth be noised abroad.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then shall rise up in the house of mourning
the widow of a month, and dry her weeping
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then shall the maid of many summers lay
aside her pets, to readjust her charms, and disinter
her smiles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then shall the doting damsel, when her
parent maketh fast the door, creep out some
other way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And they all shall come trooping as with
the voice of birds to court thy smiles and thy
manners, and thy years shall be as the silk of
the spider in thy way.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Then was he exceedingly glad because of the
crone’s advice, and he went away to his own
home rejoicing.</p>

to the great city by the sea, and lodged at the
house of a friend.</p>

sapphires, and put massive rings upon his
fingers, and seals upon his chain.</p>

<p class='c006'>And even as the crone had directed, he
scrupled not to stand in the hall-ways, and in
the market-places, and in the houses of exchange,
and sought to be observed of the
people, and lived as a man having great possessions.</p>

<p class='c006'>And not many days after, a fair lady of that
place looking from her window, saw that the
stranger shone like the mid-day sun, even so
much that her heart was warmed.</p>

<p class='c006'>So she called the keeper of the house aside
and questioned him concerning the stranger,
saying:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is this stranger that lodgeth in thy
house, who beameth with jewels like the noonday
sun? Make him known to me, for he is a
choice and goodly man, and my heart warmeth
for the stranger.”</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>PARTNER WANTED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then answered the good man of the house,
“He is a sojourner from the valley of Berryessa,
and lo, he is a man of great possessions;
and moreover, take heed if he cometh in your
way, that ye smile graciously upon him, for be
it known unto you he is a bachelor, who cometh
amongst us seeking a wife.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Then was the damsel exceedingly moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when it came to pass that the stranger
was introduced to her, she smiled graciously
upon him, and she opened her mouth and spake
knowingly of barley, and of rye, and of corn in
the ear, and of tares.</p>

<p class='c006'>And she also spake of four-footed beasts, of
calves, of pigs, and of goats, and cattle after
their kind; and of fowls; of doves, and of
ducks, and of geese, and poultry after their
kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>And she spoke also of cabbages, and of
squashes, and of turnips, and of new laid eggs,
and of honey, and of buckwheat cakes, and of
cheese, and of sausages!</p>

<p class='c006'>And lo! the farmer’s heart was touched, for
she was comely to look upon, and wise withal.</p>

<p class='c006'>And he communed within himself, saying:
“Surely this maid would indeed be a great
catch, she would make her husband’s home
cheerful, and in divers ways pluck from the
palm of life the festering thorns. Beshrew me,
but I will lay strong siege to the damsel’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So he made haste to pull wide open the mouth
of his purse and loaded her with presents, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>the damsel had found favor in his eyes, and he
sought to win her.</p>

<p class='c006'>And not many days after he espoused the
maiden, and there was great feasting and merry
making at that house, and the same was heard
of the neighbors.</p>

<p class='c006'>And on the following day, the farmer took
her to his own home, in the valley of Berryessa,
and they lived happily together for the space of
many years.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>HEELS UP AND HEAD DOWN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>A stout old gentleman was enjoying the
luxury of a salt-water bath in the bay, a
short distance from where I was fishing. As
he was a poor swimmer—notwithstanding he
had a good supply of blubber—he attached a
couple of inflated air-bags to his shoulders, by
means of a string under his arm-pits. During
his splashing about, and his repeated endeavors
to strike out like Cassius bearing Cæsar from
the troubled waters of the Tiber, the floats
changed their position from his shoulders to his
hips. This change he was not prepared for,
and the result was distressing in the extreme.
He immediately commenced sinking—as sailors
say—by the head. In vain would he make long
and desperate reaches toward the bottom, striving
to anchor his feet in the soft sand. Just as
his toes would touch the bed below, the buoyancy
of the supports and undercurrent combined
would prevail against him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Up would come his pedal extremities to the
surface, and consequently down he would go,
head first, like a pearl diver, grasping at the
pebbles beneath. After making a commotion
in the water like the screw of a tug boat, which
brought small crabs and crawfish to the top
with dismembered limbs, he would manage to
get his head above water long enough to get a
mouthful of fresh air, but retire immediately
below to digest it. Some Italian fishermen,
running in from the offing with their day’s
catch, sighted the old gentleman beating off the
Point. They mistook him for a “devil fish,” or
some other odd-looking inhabitant of the briny
deep, disporting itself in the sheltered waters
of the bay. Getting out their hooks and harpoons
ready for action, and changing course,
they bore down with all possible speed in the
direction of the singular monster.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wind was blowing quite fresh, and it
wasn’t long until the Italians came nigh enough
to ascertain the real state of affairs, and rescue
the unfortunate swimmer from his perilous
situation. The fishermen rolled the old gentleman
over a keg they had in the boat for half an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>hour, before his stomach could be emptied of
its washy load and breathing rendered easy.
When sufficiently relieved to admit of speech,
the bather gave his rescuers to understand that
in future the tide might ebb and flow, be warm
as milk new drawn from the cow, and tranquil
as a frozen pond, but a common bath-tub would
be rivers, lakes—yea, oceans—to him during the
remainder of his natural life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE BITTER END.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>While in one of the interior counties to-day
I stood beside the graves of six
members of one household. The father and
his five sons all fell in one sanguinary family
feud.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems an ill feeling had long existed between
two families named respectively Frost
and Coates. Though they frequently indulged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>in small skirmishes—from which black eyes,
bloody noses, or slit ears were the principal
trophies borne away—they had never met when
their full forces were under arms. And for the
happy hour that would bring about such a meeting,
each party looked forward with interest, if
not impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>A day arrived at last, full of promise. It was
an election day. Each party expected the other
out in strength, with furbished arms, and prepared
themselves accordingly. They took the
street, resolved, that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“Ere the bat had flown</div>
      <div class='line'>His cloistered flight: ere to black Hecate’s summons</div>
      <div class='line'>The shard-borne beetle, with his drowsy hums,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had rung night’s yawning peal, there would be done</div>
      <div class='line'>A deed of dreadful note.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Two planets keep not their motion in one
sphere, nor could two quarrelsome families
move long in a small village, or freely patronize
the same groggeries without a collision. Towards
evening they met, some mounted and
more on foot, and from low jests amongst themselves
respecting each other’s lack of prowess
upon former occasions, the controversy soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>reached the point of positive contradictions. As
the “lie direct” is equivalent to a well-developed
kick to your average fighting man, hostilities
soon commenced.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p364.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>LIVELY WORK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Coates family opened the engagement
with a brisk fusilade, and at the first fire the
gray-bearded patriarch of the Frost faction went
down with all his imperfections on his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>The firing now became general. “From rank
to rank, the volleyed thunder flew.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Neutral parties fled from the street, and for
a time transacted business with “closed doors.”
The report of the firearms frightened the horse
of a disinterested gentleman, who was riding
through the village, and despite his efforts to
control the animal, it dashed directly between
the belligerent parties. The fighting men, however,
did not slacken fire on his account, but
blazed away without seeming to notice or care
whether the agitated stranger went down in the
general <em>melee</em> or not. Fortunately, the gentleman
escaped injury, but it was certainly more
by chance than good guidance. It is said so
rapid was the fire that a steady blaze seemed
issuing from the muzzle of their weapons.
When the smoke of battle raised, five of the
Coates family were lying dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other side, Frost and one of his sons
were killed, and a son-in-law mortally wounded.
People say the funeral was a saddening spectacle.
Amongst the mourners were mothers,
daughters, sisters and wives.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the end was not yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the grass had taken root upon the
graves, the ground was again broken, and another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>victim of the malignant feud was hidden
from the sight of friends and foes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fires of hate still smouldered, and within
a year another of the Coates family was put
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors du combat</span></i>, while going one night from the
village to his ranch.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was seen leaving for home on horseback
at nine o’clock, but about ten his horse ran
masterless into the farm-yard. The man was
found lying by the roadside dead, a bullet having
passed through his head. Suspicion reverted
to the Frost family, but no proof could be
brought to establish their guilt. The public
finger still points toward them, however, and
doubtless will continue so to do for many a day,
or until the mystery is cleared up.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>A TRIP TO THE INTERIOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>A flying trip into the interior has not
favorably impressed me. There were too
many mosquitoes—too many graybacks. It is
too far from civilization, and too nigh the sun.
I stopped over night in a small city, and the
first thing that attracted my attention on entering
the place was the pale and sickly look of
the inhabitants. This I attributed to the fever
and ague, the hot weather, and impure river
water which they drink. I was credibly informed
by several parties that their pallor was
owing to the quantity of blood that is nightly
extracted from their veins by the mosquitoes.
From the number of these pests infesting the
place, it has taken the name of “The Mosquito
City.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Those people who cannot indulge in such a
luxury as mosquito bars, have to sleep during
the day. They sit up nights and wage war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>against their ferocious enemies with tobacco
smoke, burning leather, wet towels, or any other
weapon to which they can conveniently resort.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p368.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A MOSQUITO ON THE SCENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To be stung by a black hornet or a scorpion
is bad; to be bitten by a tarantula or rattlesnake
is worse; but to be punctured to the
bone by the bugle of one of these mosquitoes is
terrible. They are enormous insects. When
flying through the air they are as discernible as
thistle-down, or even humming birds. The
sharp tube through which they sap their victim’s
blood is fully three-quarters of an inch
long, and resembles a cambric needle; this
they steadily and unhesitatingly press into the
flesh until they either strike a bone, or their
forehead prevents them from doing deeper
injury.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Towards evening they rise with pining maws
from the low, damp land around the city—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Innumerable as the blades of green,</div>
      <div class='line'>That carpet the vale of the San Joaquin;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and as they close in upon the devoted inhabitants,
their blended cries swell in pitch and compass
until the sound resembles the impassioned
tone of a fish-peddler’s horn. I stopped at a
hotel in the lower part of the city, and before
retiring for the night looked carefully about the
room. As few mosquitoes were in sight, I concluded
to sleep without using the bar. Congratulating
myself on being assigned a room
where so few of the common enemy of man
were lying in wait, I extinguished the light and
turned in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scarce was I stretched upon the couch when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At once there rose such hungry yells,</div>
      <div class='line'>From every point the compass tells,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>that I lost no time in striking a light and adjusting
the netting. I now saw them emerging
from every conceivable hiding place. Trooping
they came, from behind picture-frames,
from under the bureau; out of vases and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>old empty bottles. They were climbing and
clambering and pitching towards me with
energy. I noticed a steady stream of them
shooting out of the closet through the key-hole,
with such velocity that they went warping
half-way across the apartment before they
could check themselves sufficiently to tack
around and dive for the bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had all they bargained for, to get
safely through that key-hole, too. There was
not much spare room, I can tell you. But for
the great pressure from behind kept up by
others anxious to get through, many a large
fellow would have been sticking in that opening
yet. But once they got started in, there
was no backing out; no, indeed! On! on’,
was the cry, and they pressed forward with a
rush, often sacrificing a leg or wing by the
maneuver. But they didn’t seem to care for
the loss of one of those members so long as
their bill remained intact. Deprive a mosquito
of one wing, and he will seem to laugh
at you while he makes the other do double
duty. Brush off one leg, and he will shake the
remaining ones triumphantly in your face.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>
<img src='images/p371.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>TO THE HILT IN BLOOD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But damage his bill and you demoralize him
at once. He becomes immediately disheartened.
He loses caste among his companions and confidence
in himself. He wabbles about here and
there to no purpose, like an old bachelor. You
deprive him at once of his song and his supper.
You can hardly picture to yourself a more dejected
insect, one more hopelessly down in the
mouth. He withdraws to the ceiling, or curtain,
and looks with envious eyes upon his associates
gorging themselves while his poor digestive
organs are drying through inactivity.</p>

<p class='c006'>We would be inclined to pity him in his sad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>condition, were it not that we hold the whole
insect race as coming under our ban. The
whine of disappointment, long, loud and quavering,
that went up when they ascertained I
was protected, will always remain a fixture in
my memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they closed around the bed, so numerous
were they, their flight was actually impeded.
Down they settled with locked wings on the
bar above me, thick as snow-flakes around some
old uprooted pine by the Madawaska. I had
long heard of the mosquitoes of this locality, and
was prepared for an introduction to formidable
insects, but found them even worse than I expected.</p>

<p class='c006'>Discouraged by the mosquitoes, I fled to a
neighboring city, only to find that it is the
stronghold of fever and ague. In other parts it
may be more active for a few months of the
year, but here it stays by the people like their
consciences. The winds may rise and comb
the valley until the very grass is lifted by the
roots and borne to the mountains. The sun
may grow weary of well doing, enter Capricorn,
and for a season be hid; or the rains may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>descend until the narrow slough—by which the
city is situated—becomes a wide-spreading lake,
through which ships of the line might plow with
safety; but the chills and fever stays by them
still. There is no “shaking” it off. It holds its
grip like a mortgage. The tender limbs of the
new-born babe, and the pithless bones of ripe
old age, shiver alike in its awful grasp.</p>

<p class='c006'>The citizens of this sad place are a serious,
matter-of-fact people, who seem to think it was
not the original intention that men should spend
any time in laughter, for they indulge very little
in witticisms or humor. A good joke is often
lost upon them, and the perpetrator of a bad
one places himself in jeopardy. A person who
attempts a pun that does not carry its point
before it, like a sword-fish, is in danger of being
immediately seized from behind and hurried in
the direction of the Insane Asylum.</p>

<p class='c006'>While stopping in this delightful place I visited
the small theatre of which the inhabitants
are justly proud, and shall never forgive myself
if I fail to mention the orchestra, that discoursed
most eloquent music on that occasion.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>
<img src='images/p374.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE ORCHESTRA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Whether the regular musicians of the theatre
were on a strike for higher wages, and the manager
was obliged to bring in outside talent, I did
not learn; but certain it was, the sole instrument
that kept the audience awake between the acts,
the night in question, was a large piece—a
bassoon, I think—filled and manipulated by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>stout, spectacled representative from the Faderland.</p>

<p class='c006'>In addition to the musician’s frog-shaped body—which
of itself would doubtless have attracted
my attention—he had a head that was truly a
study. To say he was bald, is to make a remark
that would be applicable to about two-thirds of
the gentlemen in the theatre, but to say that his
head was as smooth, as shiny, and devoid of
hair, from the eyebrows to the very nape of the
neck, as a billiard ball, is hardly doing the head
justice. It seemed actually peeled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, it was of a conical form, and as I
looked upon it I thought what an advantage it
would have been to me in my younger days if I
had had some such thing in the barn-yard, over
which to break pumpkins for the cattle. I am
certain a pumpkin or squash brought down
upon such an object with well-centred precision,
would fly into as many fragments as the Turkish
Empire.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was not the only person whose attention was
arrested by that marvelous development. If a
diamond the size of a rutabaga had suddenly
flashed, the audience would scarcely have turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>with greater haste to contemplate its beauties
than they did to regard that head the instant the
hat was removed.</p>

<p class='c006'>It had such a smooth and polished surface
that the actors, as they passed back and forth
upon the stage, were mirrored out upon it in
Liliputian proportions. The large globe light
was reflected so perfectly upon that glossy scalp
that it shed a positive light to remote corners of
the auditorium; and a person would look first
at the head, then up at the globe, and then down
at the head again, and <em>then</em> hardly be prepared
to decide from which object the original rays of
light proceeded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The musician had one original “turn” which
afforded me much amusement. At the commencement
of a tune he would sit facing the
stage, which was proper enough; but as he proceeded
he would turn by degrees until he was
sitting full face to the audience.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gods in the gallery seemed to consider
it their especial privilege to pelt his head with
peanuts; and when one would happen to
hit—which was quite often—it would bound
and skip from the polished object in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>manner that would invariably bring down the
house.</p>

<p class='c006'>Standing as it did in bold relief from the dark
panel-work and drapery behind, it was a most
excellent and inviting mark. Man though I am,
with the sobering cares of life closing gloomily
around me, I actually regretted I couldn’t try a
shot at the old codger’s head myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been said “The king of Shadows loves
a shining mark.” If this is so, how that musician
managed to escape the arrows so long is
more than I can understand. For many a year
he certainly has presented a target worthy the
whole archery of the realm of Death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The evening’s entertainment was made up of
selections from Shakespeare’s tragedies, “Macbeth,”
and “Othello.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>
<img src='images/p378.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>MACBETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The principal actor, whose name I forget, was
the oddest and hungriest looking player I ever
saw stalk across a stage, or foam and fret in
histrionic effort. He looked as though he had
been dangling from the lowest spoke of Fortune’s
wheel for the last twenty years. His
make-up was terrible also, and after I learned
the performance was not an intentional burlesque, I could hardly keep from hooting whenever
he appeared. As the evening advanced,
however, he warmed up considerably. When
he appeared as the murderous Thane moving
toward the apartments of his slumbering victim,
huskily repeating the thrilling lines, “The bell
invites me! I go, and it is done!” he looked
every inch a villain, and the little theatre rung
again with the clapping and clattering of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>enthusiastic audience. In “Othello” his dress
was even worse than in “Macbeth.” In the
scene where he smothers Desdemona, he was
barefooted, and looked supremely ridiculous. I
would have given double the amount I paid for
admission for the glorious privilege of kicking
him across the stage.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p379.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>OTHELLO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>The customary pitcher-shaped lamp which
the “Moor” usually bears in his hand upon
this occasion, and to which he alludes when he
says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</div>
      <div class='line'>I can again thy former light restore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should I repent me,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>was not procurable. The tragedian therefore
carried a candle stuck in the neck of a large
wine-bottle, and under his left arm he carried a
pillow about the size of a single-bed mattress,
with which to put out the light of the fair Desdemona,
who was lying upon a lounge at the
left of the stage. I was too great a lover of
Shakespeare to sit longer by and witness the
terrible butchery. I arose and left the house,
and as I passed out, the pitying glances of the
audience informed me that they didn’t understand
the real state of affairs, but thought I was
taken suddenly ill. I was ill at ease, and had
been, during the entire evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the way down the next morning an over
land passenger made my acquaintance on the
cars, and while conversing about the long snow
sheds and tunnels he had passed, I informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>him of the long tunnel through which we would
pass on leaving the valley.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are we near that tunnel now?” he asked.
“Yes,” I answered, “we will enter it in about
fifteen minutes.” “Is the tunnel dark?” he inquired.
“Yes, very dark,” I replied, “ten shades
darker than a cloudy midnight.” “By jingo!”
he cried, “that’s just the thing for me. I forgot
to put on a clean shirt last night, and I hate
like the deuce to arrive at my destination looking
as I do now. Do you think a fellow would
have time to put a shirt on while passing
through it?” he continued, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He might,” I answered, “if he had it ready
before reaching the tunnel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’ll try a pull, anyway,” he said, as he
took down the valise from a rack overhead to
select the garment. “I’ll have it all ready for a
hoist,” he continued, “and if I don’t climb into
it faster than a spark into a chimney, I’m not
what I think I am, that’s all;” and with a look
of determination he went to a seat in the rear
of the car, and for a time seemed busily engaged
preparing for the great change.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had made an error in regard to the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>that would elapse before we reached the tunnel,
and the result was we reached it before he was
fully prepared for it. Into it the locomotive
plunged with a wild scream. Gloom closed
around the passengers, hiding the nearest
objects from their view. On we sped. The
rattling of the trucks told us rail after rail was
passed, but still a darkness that might be felt
enveloped the rushing train.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who were conversing as the car entered
the tunnel, stopped as though the icy hand of
death had been laid upon their throat. The
half-uttered word rested upon the tongue, and
the tunnel, like a long dash, stretched between
the parts of a sentence.</p>

<p class='c006'>I thought of the passenger, doubtless by this
time struggling into his linen, and turned around
in my seat facing him. With considerable
interest I waited the return of light. At last it
came glimmering far ahead. Plainer and plainer
the objects grew around, and first and most
noticeable of all, was the tall form of the passenger
from over the mountains, leaning over
the seat in front of him, enveloped in his snowy
linen, his hands stuck in the sleeves at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>elbows, and his head vainly endeavoring to
shoot through the opening at the neck, which in
his haste he had neglected to unbutton.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p383.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A STARTLING APPARITION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding his head was enveloped, he
was conscious that light had dawned upon the
scene, and his struggles and frantic thrusts became
painful to look upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally the fastening at the neck gave way,
and his face came through the opening, red as
a pickled beet. Fortunately most of the passengers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>were sitting with backs toward him
and but few witnessed the terrible struggle.
One old lady, however, got nearly frightened
out of her wits. When objects began to grow
visible around her, she became suddenly
apprised of the startling fact that a white figure
was bent over her, with outstretched wings fanning
the air, and she very naturally came to the
conclusion that an angel was about to gather
her to her fathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ashen look of the poor old body, as she
stole a glance over her shoulder at the white
object behind, showed that however fitted she
was—in respect of years—for the final taking
off, she was anything but willing to start upon
such an uncertain journey.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE ART GALLERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Hearing that a large collection of paintings
were on exhibition at the Art Gallery,
I visited the rooms this afternoon, and was
agreeably surprised to discover that quite a
number were by eminent artists.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>It is pleasant to gaze upon an old picture
that has come down through the dust of ages,
so I made it a point to employ the hour at my
disposal in sketching several subjects most
admired by the visitors. I did not learn the
author of the large picture from which the first
of my sketches was taken, but was assured that
it came from the hand of an old master.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p392.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>FROM A PAINTING BY AN OLD MASTER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I would have thought it a representation of
“Cleopatra before Cæsar,” if the female had
been running toward the man instead of away
from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gentleman present who examined the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>painting closely, gave it as his opinion, that the
couple represented “Tarquin and Lucrece.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He informed me he had visited many art
galleries of the Old World, and found several
paintings which had been copied from this
masterpiece by artists, who paid homage to such
creative genius.</p>

<p class='c006'>As he claimed to be something of a connoisseur,
his supposition was probably a correct one,
though he was not able to thoroughly account
for the singular looking bonnet that shadowed
the head of the prancing “Lucrece.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certainly anything but a Roman head-dress,
and why it should be dangling from her
royal top, is something for critics to comment on,
and antiquarians to inquire into.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another little sketch attracted great attention,
especially from the ladies, whose love for the
beautiful is only excelled by their love for the
good. It was entitled “Love’s Young Dream.”
I regret I am not able to give the artist’s name.
I could not get near enough to decipher the
signature, owing to the crowd of ladies admiring
the beautiful gem.</p>

<p class='c006'>The members of the Graphic Club were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>sketching. Accepting an invitation from one I
stepped into their room to see them draw.
Quite a number of artists were present. The
famous marine painter was there, who loves to
paint the vessel going before the wind, when in
its might it takes “the ruffian billows by the
top.” It was pleasant to watch his pencil pile
up the “yeasty waves” at will.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p394.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“LOVE’S YOUNG DREAM.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>It was also interesting to lean over the landscape
painter’s shoulder and see the branches
sprout from his grand old oaks, against whose
trunks it would seem the storms of centuries
had spent their force.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was no less pleasant or interesting to perceive
the horns shoot from the animal painter’s
cows. As the creature grows under his active
pencil, we may be inclined to think she will be
of the Mooley species, and never shake a gory
horn above a prostrate victim; but alas! a few
hasty but well directed strokes, and she stands
forth more formidable than the armed rhinoceros
or rampant unicorn. Then we hold our breath,
as we see the pencil slide away to some other
locality before a tail is attached to the body,
and inwardly wonder whether the artist has
forgotten to bestow upon her that graceful adjunct,
or is intentionally giving us a new species
of cattle. We heave a sigh of relief when the
pencil returns, after a brief skirmish along the
ribs, to bestow upon the cow that terminal
appendage, at once a scourge for milk-maids
and a swing for dogs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>A ROLLING STONE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>This afternoon, while climbing a steep hill
that overlooks the bay, in company with a
gentleman named Stone, I saw an illustration
of the old maxim, “A rolling stone gathers no
moss.” We had almost completed the ascent,
when Stone’s feet slipped from under him, and
striking upon his side he commenced a rapid
descent.</p>

<p class='c006'>About four hundred feet of steep grade
stretched before him without let or hindrance.
I saw at a glance he was bound to pass over
every inch of the space before he stopped.
Onward he went, gathering speed as he proceeded,
and catching wildly around him at every
revolution; but, as there was nothing growing
upon the barren slope but stunted grass or
brittle moss, his efforts to “slow speed” were
in vain. After he had made about ten revolutions
his hat came off, and for a short time the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>race between him and his tile was truly interesting.
It would have been an even bet, which
would first reach the fence at the bottom of the
hill. After making about half the distance, however,
the hat swung in ahead of him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p397.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A THROUGH PASSENGER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Whether it was the wind acted upon it I
couldn’t tell, but Stone overhauled it, and passing
over it, materially injured its form as a
roller, by giving it an oblong shape, and soon
left the crushed hat wabbling far behind. He
turned neither to the right nor to the left, but
rolled as straight down the hill as a saw-log
down the bank of a river into a mill-pond.
Goats nibbling in the vicinity paused in their
repast and looked pitifully at the gentleman as
he went tumbling by them, and evidently congratulated
themselves on being goats, that feel
at home on the steepest hillside that nature
can present to their hoofs. When, in his mad
career, my friend Stone would reach some
intercepting shelf he would bounce about three
feet into the air, and continue down the incline
with increased velocity. Nor did he stop his
brilliant course until he brought up whack
against the fence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fortunately he was unhurt, but was so dizzy
that everything was turning around him for an
hour afterwards. He declares that though he
should live until he becomes so old as to forget
the way to his mouth, he has taken his last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>look at the city and the surrounding bay from
the summit of that hill. And when we think
of his last descent from that high altitude, we
can hardly wonder at the declaration.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>RIDING IN THE STREET CARS.</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The greater portion of this day I have spent
riding in the street cars. I find it is quite
a pleasant way of passing a few leisure hours.
Neither is it an extravagant way of entertaining
one’s self.</p>

<p class='c006'>On figuring up I find, by choosing the longest
routes, it cost just seven and one-quarter cents
per hour. This is certainly reasonable.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>
<img src='images/p400.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE SIGNAL STATION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is always something amusing to look
at as you pass along. There stands the nervous old lady upon the street corner. She
wishes to ride, and endeavors to signal the
driver and prepare for embarking at one and
the same time. She proves the truth of the old
saying that a person may get too many irons in
the fire. In her eagerness to attract the attention
of the driver or conductor, she is not aware
that in lifting her skirts she has elevated one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>two thicknesses more than she intended, or than
is at all necessary. Poor old lady! She does
indeed present a picture that might well attract
the artistic eye. We in more becoming order
turn our eyes from the singular spectacle and
study the advertisements ranged around for
our special benefit. She emits a short, quick
cry, half whoop and half squeal, and signals
repeatedly, to do which the inevitable umbrella
is brought into requisition, and flourished
around her head as though she was warding off
a detachment of aggressive wasps. She gives
the conductor a look of surprise, if not anger,
because he completes the curve before stopping
to take her up. The old lady means business,
and has never got it through her head that conductors
have rights which she is bound to
respect. She no doubt believes that on all
occasions and at all times he ought to seize the
strap and stop the car as suddenly as he would
a clock by grasping the pendulum.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there are the fashions which we can
study without having to pay exorbitant prices
for seats in the theatres. It is even better than
to go to a fashionable church.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Besides the advantages which a ride in the
street car offers us in the way of studying
the fashions, we often see strange sights, well
calculated to awaken humor. There, for instance,
we encounter the sleepy passenger,
who, in charity let us hope, is drowsy through
loss of rest, rather than loss of reason! Let us
hope he is some physician who has been attending
to his patients; or a minister of the gospel
who has spent the night by the bedside of some
sinking penitent; or a supervisor, who—while
his constituents have been snugly dreaming
away their troubles—has been legislating, and
growing hoarse declaiming for the public
good. Doctor or supervisor, as the case may
be, it is evident he is sleepy, and cares
not who knows it. Otherwise he would
pick up his hat, which has fallen off, before
it has twice been stepped on by passengers
staggering through the car while it is in
motion.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a persistency truly amusing he tips in
the direction of some old lady, who apparently
hates men, especially when excessive drowsiness
makes them familiar. He, however, is oblivious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>of her likes or dislikes, even of her presence, it
would seem.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p403.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>RATHER “SLOROPPY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He bobs towards her until his dishevelled
forelock actually tickles her under the ear,
which sensation causes her to start suddenly,
and look around so quickly, that a person must
think the movement gave her a crick in the neck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>and her subsequent rubbing of the cords below
the ear would seem to bear out the supposition
as correct.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p404.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SNIFFING THE BATTLE FROM AFAR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then, as we ride along we can see the bold
policeman! standing by the corner of a building.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>He is earnestly looking down a narrow
lane, taking notes perhaps; but more likely
watching the progress of a fight, and wisely
waiting until all the pistols are discharged
before venturing to arrest any of the belligerent
parties. He looks as though it would not take
much longer reflection or many more shots, to
make him forego that duty <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i>, and turn
around to arrest the poor Chinese vegetable
peddler, who, with his basket pole upon his
shoulder, is trotting along upon the sidewalk,
and thereby violating one of the city ordinances.
While hustling the prisoner to the station house
he would escape performing more unpleasant
and risky business.</p>

<p class='c006'>He is in the right of it, too, when a person
comes right down to reason the case. The
policeman may have a family depending on him
for support. Or it may be upon the very stroke
of the hour when his duty for the day will cease,
and he can saunter to his home, leaving his successor
to rush in and stay the slaughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be argued that the policeman is paid
to take prisoners, and consequently to take
chances. This is true, but he is not paid to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>commit suicide. For a broad man like him to
move down a narrow lane up which the bullets
are whistling, can hardly be considered anything
short of it. Oh! he is a cunning fellow I tell
you, and revolves the matter carefully in his
mind before taking action.</p>

<p class='c006'>He has been too long a resident of the city,
and too long a member of the “star brigade,”
not to know that the city can better afford to
lose two or three indifferent citizens than it can
one able and efficient policeman.</p>

<p class='c006'>We turn from the policeman to contemplate
the blooming blonde, who comes bouncing in
with her poodle dog in her arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>After she is seated she amuses some of the
passengers and displeases more, by the affectionate
names she lavishes upon the little watery-eyed
pet in her lap. Some of the passengers
would doubtless like to be the dog and others
would like to be a distemper that they might
legally kill the cur. She temporarily ends her
caresses by repeatedly kissing its cold peaked
nose, to the infinite disgust of the majority of
the passengers, who, rather than witness a repetition
of the silly act, look out of the windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and become suddenly interested in the construction
of the buildings or fences along the
route.</p>

<p>ALIGHTING GRACEFULLY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And then there is the impatient passenger,
who is either limited in time or sense, probably
in both.</p>

<p class='c006'>He foolishly attempts to leave the car while
it is in motion, in order to save a few moments.
Immediately afterwards he wishes he hadn’t,
and sits down with considerable feeling to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>over his rashness. There was a time, no doubt,
when he could jump on and off a car like a
newsboy; but that time has evidently gone by.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we consider the roughness of his seat,
and the unexpected manner in which he settled
on it, we have to acknowledge that he sits with
considerable grace. However, as he has lost
time instead of gaining it, by the action, he
will perhaps try to catch a better hold of the
old rascal’s forelock the next time he is running
past him.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>No poet, however gifted, can get along without
his muse, any better than a navigator
can without his compass. If the goddess is not
at his elbow, the lyre hangs mute upon the wall,
and the pen corrodes in the ink. Then what
can the poor limited rhymer do without a muse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>to inspire him? As mine is at present leaning

  <h2 class='c004'>THE VALUE OF A COLLAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Dear me! what a terrible dodging life the
poor city cur leads, to be sure, whose
owner does not consider him of sufficient importance
to warrant taking out a license. His
excursions must necessarily be limited.</p>

<p class='c006'>He never dares to bark in the daytime, and
now I think of it, that may account for his howling
all night. To bark between the hours of
seven in the morning and six in the evening
would be equivalent to running his head into
the pound-keeper’s lariat. He knows it, too,
the rascal, and hardly indulges in a yelp, even
if his tail is trod upon. I have always noticed
that the eyes of the cur that wears no collar—(which
would entitle him to the freedom of the
city)—protrude from the sockets much farther
than the optics in the head of the licensed
animal. I have noticed this fact and pondered
over it, striving not a little to arrive at some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>satisfactory conclusion in regard to the matter.
It may be that this strange protrusion is brought
about by the continual strain while on the lookout
for the pound-keeper or his sneaking aids.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another peculiarity about the unlicensed cur,—his
eyes are invariably the color of tobacco
juice. “Why are they so?” you probably
inquire. Be patient, and I will tell you? It is
the result of the burning envy continually agitating
his breast and adding a bloodier lustre
to his orbs.</p>

<p class='c006'>How must envy consume his very vitals when
he beholds his younger brother, perhaps, trotting
forth into the street, his neck encircled with the
leather zone that insures him respect and
immunity from assault; while he must cower
behind the ash barrel, and wait for night to
temporarily shield him from insult and injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old adage is hardly applicable to his
case. He has no <em>day</em>, but he has his night,
however, and he would be a fool not to make
the most of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>How trifling a thing will draw the line between
him and his licensed brother. One
white foot, perhaps, a spot too many on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>head, or want of one above the tail may have
cursed him through the length and breadth of
his existence. If he lives it must be by his
wits. Every man’s hand or boot seems to be
against him. The licensed dog can stretch
lazily upon the sidewalk and oblige the pedestrians
to go around him rather than take
the chances of stepping over, or stirring him
up with a kick.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>NO COLLAR, NO CRUMBS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is dangerous business, this waking up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>dog with your boot. You may take him in a
time when not in the mood for permitting such
familiar demonstrations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps he may be hungry, and since the
dogs devoured poor painted Jezebel, their
weakness for human flesh will occasionally
make itself manifest. I, who have been thrice
vaccinated by a canine tooth (and it took each
time, too), speak knowingly on this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, as I gaze out upon the street, I mark
the slow approach of the pound-keeper’s dingy
cart. Ever and anon it comes to a sudden halt,
and skirmishers are deployed on each side to
search the alley-ways and lanes along the
route. Hark! what cry is this that comes quavering
forth from that shaky prison? A bark?
No, never a bark, but a quavering bleat from the
pale lips of a poor old goat. Alas! poor goat.</p>

<p class='c006'>It, too, was evidently straying about unlawfully,
in some one’s garden, perhaps, or stripping
the posters off the fence before the paste
was dry, or the bill-sticker a block away, and in
consequence he is now occupying a position that,
however exalted it may be in one sense, makes
him feel very ill at ease all the same.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>His fellow prisoners are dogs of every breed
under the sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no discrimination in that moving
prison, no separate cells. The full blood setter
pup fares no better than the worthless poodle
that couldn’t smell a quail a yard distant unless
it was roasting. The big, sour, surly mastiff,
with blood-shot eyes and pendent jowl, who long
has been the acknowledged champion of a block,
and in his day lacerated many a paw, hasn’t
even a growl to offer, but crouches side by
side with the poor maimed and mongrel cur
that for years has been racking through life
on three legs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still the dismal looking cart jolts along attracting
the attention of the passing crowds. Still
the villainous-looking aids, who flank the vehicle,
trail their ready lariats, and dart exploring
glances into every nook and corner. And as I
gaze, I marvel to see how quickly the outlaws
get a knowledge of its approach, and stand not
upon the order of their going, but precipitately
leave for back yards and kitchens.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>QUAINT EPITAPHS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>While strolling through an old cemetery
this afternoon I was surprised at
the number of quaint epitaphs there to be
found.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a while I almost imagined myself rummaging
among the old time-worn tombstones in
some English or Welsh burying-ground. Many
are written in verse, especially on the stones
erected during a certain period, extending over
about ten years, which proves that during these
years the city had a tombstone poet among her
citizens.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was an odd genius, whoever he was, this
graveyard rhymer.</p>

<p class='c006'>One peculiarity seems to have been his coupling
with the epitaph a brief account of the
manner in which the deceased party was taken
off. The first inscription which attracted my
notice as odd, was chiseled upon a large marble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>slab which leaned over the spot where a party
who had borne the ancient and honorable name
of “Smith,” rested from his labors. The obituary
ran thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Smith ran to catch his fatted hog,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And carried the knife around;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He slipped and fell;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The hog is well,</div>
      <div class='line'>But Smith is under ground.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This stanza should be introduced into public
schools, and adopted as a morning chant, to
impress upon the mind of the pupils the importance
of a person’s having his wits about
him. Death brought about by such gross carelessness
as Smith showed, is—to say the least—first
cousin to suicide, and doubtless there
will come a time when Smith’s case will be inquired
into.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under a large oak tree on the south side I
came upon a tombstone which bore no date, but
had evidently been erected many years. The
fence which once enclosed the grave had nearly
disappeared, nothing remaining except a few
rotten stakes protruding through the grass.
What once had been a mound was now a hollow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>which told the mute gazer, decay had done
its worst.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through a rank growth of weeds and briers,
a few pale neglected flowers raised their delicate
faces, like virtue struggling heavenward through
the retarding throng inhabiting this naughty
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The headstone was evidently erected before
the poet’s day, and he who erected it had composed
the epitaph. It is more than likely he
chiseled it also, as the letters were ill-shaped
and irregular, and looked as though carved out
with a pick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a <em>fac-simile</em> of the inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>“Cynthy Ann is berried here.</div>
    <div>Be easy with her,</div>
    <div>Lord,</div>
    <div>And, you won’t lose nothin’,</div>
    <div>She was a plaguey good wife to me</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>She wouldn’t be druv.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That “Cynthia Ann” had faults is evident
from the tone. But I thought as I turned from
the spot, if her greatest fault lay in not allowing
herself to be “druv,” her prospects were better
than the average.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>What a contrast was the line inscribed upon
a tombstone directly opposite:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He sleeps in Heaven.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mere speculation only, and wild at that. The
extravagant notion that a person sleeps in Paradise
must have emanated from the brain of
some sluggard, who thought that heaven without
sleep would be a wearisome place. The
“sleeper’s” name was Gregg, and from a representation
of a pair of scissors cut upon the slab
I presumed he was a tailor. On making
inquiry of the sexton, busily engaged closing a
grave at the time, I found my supposition was
right. Gregg was a tailor, but met death at the
heels of a horse. To use the sexton’s own
words, which were spoken in pure Greek—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Begorra he <em>was</em> a tailor, and it was meself
that planted him there. He was killed in the
barn beyant, while sthrivin’ to pull the makin’s
of a fish-line out of the tail of owld Gleason’s
stallion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When a person learns what his occupation
had been, and how he died, the assertion that
he had gone to heaven, strikes one as too ridiculous
for anything.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE SEXTON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not less amusing or quaint was the verse
inscribed upon the plain marble slab which
marked the resting-place of Mr. and Mrs. Barradier.
The stone was probably put up by
some acquaintance of the deceased couple who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>knew that their marriage had been anything
but a happy one; the verse upon it also informs
the passer-by that they left no descendants to
perform that pious duty. It said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Released from worldly care and strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here side and side lie man and wife;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with the couple buried here</div>
      <div class='line'>Expired the name of Barradier.”</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>MISTAKEN IDENTITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>An amusing scene occurred this afternoon as
I was coming up from the post-office. It
was a case of mistaken identity. It seems a
somewhat dissipated old Irish woman was deserted
some weeks ago by her husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through her domestic troubles and excessive
drinking she at times becomes quite crazy,—so
much so that her friends have to keep a constant
watch over her to prevent her from doing
mischief. She is very large and powerful, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>when in one of her tantrums is no easy person
to manage. It appears that when she has one
of these crazy spells, she imagines she recognizes
her husband’s Milesian features in almost
every face she looks upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>This afternoon, while the crazy fit was upon
her, she escaped from her keepers, and rushed
into the street with dilated eyes and dishevelled
hair. With sleeves rolled above the elbows and
clenched hands, she charged up the street, looking
right and left for some person on whom to
fasten.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was indeed ripe for an encounter, and
nearly the first person she met was a prominent
clergyman returning to his residence from the
Mercantile Library, with his newly selected book
under his arm. She stood for a moment
directly in front of the minister, and riveted
her red optics upon his face in an inquiring
stare, which soon kindled into one of recognition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Anticipating trouble, he attempted to pass
around her and proceed quietly on his way.</p>

<p class='c006'>But she was too quick for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reaching out her long bare arm, she brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>it around like the boom of a sloop, and with one
wide sweep knocked his hat spinning to the sidewalk
at her feet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p432.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE CLERGYMAN IN LIMBO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He stooped to pick it up again, and while
bent in the act, she seized him by the hair with
both hands, and giving a guttural laugh, not unlike
the self-satisfied croak of a down east bullfrog,
exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! Barney, ye galavantin’ spalpeen! ye
can’t desave me wid yer stove-pipe! So ye’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>dezart the wife o’ yer boosome, would ye? ah,
ha! come home wid me now, or I’ll be afther
takin’ your durty ould scalp along wid me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>A soft rabbit under the wide paw of a California
lion, or a sparrow in the talons of a hawk,
is not more utterly helpless than was the poor
dominie in her terrible clutch. His position was
anything but an enviable one. It actually seemed
as if every hair upon his head was gathered and
drawn into one mass, over which her muscular
fingers held complete control.</p>

<p class='c006'>He dropped his book and shouted loudly,
partly through pain, and partly anger at seeing
the fate of his fashionable hat, now lying under
her great broad foot, flat as a German pancake.</p>

<p class='c006'>His cries of fear only made the crazy woman
more confident of her abilities. She commenced
backing along the street, in the direction of
home, and at every step, with an irresistible
yank, she dragged the expostulating minister
along with her over the uneven sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had snaked him along fully two rods in
this manner, and was making, to use a nautical
phrase, such good stern-way that she was on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>point of breaking into a trot, when her heel
caught on the edge of a plank.</p>

<p class='c006'>The result was terrible in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c006'>She fell backwards, pulling the unfortunate
captive to the sidewalk after her, where they
gyrated in the most ludicrous positions imaginable.</p>

<p class='c006'>A couple of gentlemen, emerging from a
store at that instant, looked on the pair in
blank astonishment for a moment. Recognizing
their own gifted pastor, they ran to his
assistance, and lost no time in raising him to
his feet, and turning over the old crazy woman
to an officer who happened at that moment to
step out of a saloon.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE CHAMPION MEAN MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Yesterday I came across a singular looking
individual dressed in a greasy, dingy
suit. He was sitting on a log before his door
engaged in repairing a shovel-handle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, stranger,” I said, addressing him, “can
you inform me where Deacon Shellbark lives?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The farmer looked up, pushed his slouched
hat back on his head, and after surveying me
some time in silence, drawled out:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Be you any relation of his’n?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” I replied, a little surprised at his manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>of answering; “I haven’t a relative in the
State.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By thunder! I congratulate you upon your
good fortune,” he ejaculated, “particularly because
there’s no tie of consanguinity existin’
atwixt you and old Deacon Shellbark. He’s
expectin’ a son home, and I thought you mout
be him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wal,” he continued, pointing with a huge
jack-knife that he held in his hand, “you see
that house to the left of them scrub oaks, don’t
you? that ar buildin’ with the leetle coopalow
on’t? Wal, thar’s whar old Deacon Shellbark
lives; <em>the meanest man in this yer county</em>,
and that’s sayin’ considerable, too! cause we’ve
got some vicey-fisted customers round these
yer parts, men who scrape the puddin’ pot
mighty clean before the dog gits a chance
to canvass it, now I can tell ye. But I feel
safe in stickin’ in old Shellbark at the head,
and I ain’t agwine to haul him down nuther.
I don’t believe in talkin’ much about one’s
neighbors, but I ginnerally tell strangers what
sort of a man he is, cause if they go to tradin’
with him and aren’t on thar guard, he’ll skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>’em quicker than a whirlpool sucks in a dead
fish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know the Deacon, then?” I remarked,
while the hope I had entertained of getting his
name on my subscription list began to take to
itself wings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I reckon I do know him,” he replied,
“pooty well, too; a great sight better than is
profitable to him, and he knows it. Oh, you
bet he knows it, and hates me as he does the
dry murrain that gin the crows fifteen of his
best cows last summer. I knowed him back in
Scrabble Town.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They wouldn’t allow him to come within
pistol shot of a church back thar, because they
mor’n suspected he stole the wine and bread
from the communion table one day. They
were down on him flatter than a stone on a
cricket allers arterwards. He’s a deacon out
here though, but that ain’t nothin’. He can’t
fool me with his prayin’. I want no sech crooked
old disciple as he is intercedin’ for me, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was hoping he would subscribe for this
book,” I remarked, “but I am afraid there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>not much use of my going there if he is so
very mean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look’e here, stranger,” he remarked earnestly,
“you mout just as well stop thar whar
you’re standin’. Subscribe! He’ll gig back
from a subscription list jest as he would from a
six-shooter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but this is a religious work, and perhaps
he would lend that his support,” I answered
quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Religious work be shelved!” exclaimed the
farmer. “That doesn’t help ye any; you can’t
do anythin’ with him, ’cause he hain’t got no
more soul than an empty gin bottle. You
mout as well bait a rat trap with a cat’s head
and expect the varmin to go a-nibblin’ at it, as
to expect him to put his name down to anything
that’s agwine to take coin from his
pockets.</p>

<p>SLEEPY DOBY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a stranger in these yer parts I see,
and tharfore haven’t the slightest idea what a
towerin’ mean man he is; why he’d run a mile
to git on the sunny side of a feller to cheat
him out of his shadow! I knowed him back in
old Indiany. He’s from the same place that I
am, but you can kick me clear over to them
foot-hills and back ag’in if I don’t feel like
takin’ pizin every time I have to own up to it.
He used to be in cahoot with a tanner back
thar named Doby; sleepy Doby, the boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>called him, for he was the sleepiest feller you
ever did see. Go asleep while workin’ at anythin’.
He would drop asleep sometimes while
scrapin’ a hide, and cut the consarned thing all
into parin’s; at other times he would fall back
into the tan vat, then wake up and holler for
the boys to come and fish him out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They say he dropped asleep once while
ringin’ a hog to prevent him from rootin’ up
the clover patch. The minister of the village
had to pause in the middle of a sermon he was
preachin’ half a block away, until the squealin’
subsided.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But as I was gwine to tell ye, before the
rheumatism got into his j’ints, and made him
shun water as he would a tax-collector, old
Shellbark used to be pooty fond of fishin’. One
day Parson Bodfish was gwine off to have a
day’s sport, and took me along to carry the
fish. I was only a boy then, and mighty tickled
because I could go. Jest about the time we
got to the river we overtook old Shellbark
a-pointin’ thar too. When we got to the bank
they both set in gettin’ out thar hooks and lines,
and then for the first time old Shellbark found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>out he had left his bait to hum. So he commenced
to sputter and fret, takin’ on terribly
about it, until Parson Bodfish ses to him,
‘That’s all right; I reckon I’ve got enough
bait in this box for both of us, and I’ll give you
half of mine, and let us start in and make the
most of it.’ So the Parson—who had a heart
the size of a sheep’s head—took out his bait-box
and gin him more than half. It’s so; I
seed ’em when he took ’em out. Pooty soon
arter, while the parson was a-standin’ on a log
that horned out over the water, a-baitin’ of his
hooks, a big-mouthed fish-hawk gin a-chatterin’
screech overhead, and startled him a leetle, and
while lookin’ up he let his bait-box fall into the
river.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The box was open, so the worms war scattered
every which way, and away went box and
bait a-flukin’ down the rapids, and the parson’s
cusses follerin’ arter. He <em>did</em> swar, by hunky!
I heer’d him. He had a mi’ty hot temper, and
it was more than he could do sometimes to
keep it down. A feller couldn’t blame him
much for swa’rin’ jest then, ’cause ’twas a
pooty tryin’ time. He turned around sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>quick when he thought of me bein’ thar. I
seed him turnin’, though, and let on to be
talkin’ to a fish that I was stringin’ on, so he
reckoned I hadn’t noticed him. We hurried
on down the river, and arter a while overtook
old Shellbark, who was snakin ’em out as fast
as he could fix bait and throw in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I lost all my worms back thar, while
standin’ on a log,’ ses the parson, ‘and will
have to fall back on you for some.’ The old
snipe grumbled out somethin’ about bein’ out
of all patience with people who war so fool
careless. Arter a while he took out the rag he
kept the worms in, and although he had quite
a large knot of ’em, he gin the parson jest one,
and dead at that! It’s so! You may laugh,
but I seed it. When he was a-pickin’ it out
and handin’ it to him, and when Parson Bodfish
was a-stickin’ the hook into him, he lay thar and
took it as e-a-s-y, and never squirmed or objected
the least. You’d hev thought it was a
link of vermicelli the parson had picked out of
a soup plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When Parson Bodfish took it from him, he
held it between his finger and thumb a while,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>jest that way, and I swow I felt solid sure he was
agwine to slap it back into old Shellbark’s

<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>stared him in the face as if actewally in doubt
about his being the person he divided with in
the mornin’. Arter a while he baited his hook
and started in right thar. He had amazin’ good
luck, too, with one bait. He hauled out four
floppin’ great chubs, one right arter the other,
and durin’ the same time old Shellbark didn’t
get a bite from anythin’ but musquiters. He
seemed just tearin’ mad over it, too, I can tell
you.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He stood thar a-floppin’ and a-scratchin’
and a-slingin’ of his line out the full length,
tryin’ on all sides continewally, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At last, thinkin’ he had a fish when he didn’t,
he switched up his line so spiteful it caught in a
tree-top more than fifteen feet above his head;
and while he was a-gawpin’ up thar, jerkin’ the
line, and stampin’ round, he sot his foot flat onto
his string of fish that war layin’ thar on the
bank, and squashed the in’ards out of nigh
every one of ’em. Between thar slipperiness
and his confusion, hurryin’ to git off ’em before
they were sp’iled, he fell and slid away down the
bank, head fust, a-clawin’ and a-kickin’ jest like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>a skeer’d alligator. Only he chanced to strike
ag’inst an old root that was stickin’ up at the
margin of the river, he’d have gone plum to the
bottom for sartain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unfortunately the last fish Parson Bodfish
caught had swallered the bait, so he ses to me
kind of low, ‘Dolphus, let’s see if we can’t
skeer up a lizard, or somethin’ that’ll do for bait
when a man’s in a pinch.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“So we set in to huntin’ and s’archin’ under
old logs and stones, and dead wild grass, but
couldn’t git hold of anythin’. The parson fell
three times on all fours in the dirt, and gin his
wrist a mi’ty bad sprain while pursuin’ a queer,
long-legg’d horned critter somethin’ like a
cricket, only pizenous, I guess. I could have
caught it once, as it went dronin’ past, but didn’t
feel like touchin’ it. Finally it got stuck into a
clump of ferns, and he gin it up. So arter a
while he ses, ‘I’ll have to go back and try that
old Shellbark ag’in, though I’d ruther take a
dose o’ ipecac than do it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“So we come back to whar he was fishin’.
He looked mi’ty solemn, and was muddy as an
old stone boat. Ses the parson to him, ‘I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>have to call on you ag’in for another <em>dead</em> worm;
the one you gin me is all gobbled up.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Seems to me you’re mi’ty extravagint with
the bait,’ he ses gruffly, and switchin’ his line
around and slingin’ it out far as the pole would
let it go, but not makin’ the least motion to comply
with the parson’s request.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Waal, I don’t know how that is,’ ses Parson
Bodfish, kind of easy like, and tryin’ to keep
down his anger, that I seed was rizin’ jest like
bilin’ sugar, ‘I nabbed four rousin’ good fish
with that one bait. I reckon that’s doin’ pooty
well; fact I know it is. They seem to bite fust
rate at dead worms jest now.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Waal, I don’t know anythin’ about that,’
ses the old narrow gauge, ‘s’posin’ you cut up
some of your fish and see if you can’t catch
somethin’ with that sort of bait; fish bite pooty
well at that sort of an offerin’ jest before rain,
they say.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then you ain’t a gwine to give me any
worms?’ ses the parson, in a husky voice, and
shakin’ like a rag in the wind, he was so chock
full of passion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Waal, this is a sort of curious world, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Bodfish,’ ses old Shellbark, slow and niggardly
like, jest that way, ‘and without a feller looks
out for himself he ain’t considered nothin’.
‘Sides you know,’ he contin’ed, ‘fish bait is a
good deal like an oyster or a bean—somethin’
that’s mi’ty hard to divide with a feller,’ and he
commenced to troll along down stream.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Apple sass and spinage! I never did see a
man so riled as that Parson Bodfish was sence I
could distinguish the moon from a lightnin’ bug.
He changed to all the colors of the rainbow by
turns in less time than I’m tellin’ ye. You never
seed sech a struggle between sin and piety as
raged inside that parson for about five minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fust piety seemed to be gettin’ on top, then
sin would choke her down and hold her thar.
At last he turned around and run full chisel
ahind the turned up roots of a big windfall as
though a gallon and a half of black hornets
war arter him. I reckoned he was gwine arter
stuns to gin the old feller a good peltin’, and
that kind of work bein’ right into my hand I
ran thar too, cal’latin’ to help him do it. But I
was mistaken’d.</p>

<p>SWEARING TO GET EVEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“He wasn’t gwine arter stuns, for I seed so
soon as he thought he was out of sight he
flopped down on his knees right thar in the
mud, a-holdin’ his hands jined together above
his head jest that way. I allowed he was a
gwine to pray then for sartin, but he didn’t
pray; no siree, not much pra’ar jest then! he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>sw’ar’d though. He did! I heered him, jest as
plain as could be, ses he:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I sw’ar I’ll git even yet with that old Shellbark,
if I have to yank him out of his grave like
a body-snatcher, to accomplish it!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I felt like runnin’ thar and sayin,’ ‘Don’t rise
yet, let me kneel and sw’ar too,’ the same as
that tricky feller does in the play whar he’s
a-foolin’ the jealous nigger so bad; but I
knowed it wouldn’t do, ’cause he didn’t want
me to see him kneel thar in the mud. So when
he came back he found me peltin’ a frog as if
nothin’ had happened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Come, Dolphus,’ ses he, ‘its gettin’ pooty
late; I guess we mout as well be a-movin’ back
home.’ So we turned back toward the village,
though ’twa’n’t more than noon, and left old
Shellbark fishin’ thar. He did git even with him
though.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One Sunday soon arter Parson Bodfish
was”—here the farmer was interrupted by a
wild looking female who stuck her frowzy head
out of an open window, like a turtle out of its
shell, and shouted, in anything but a sweet
voice:—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>“‘Dolphus! you natural born talkin’ machine
you! what are ye a-settin’ a-pratin’ and a-pratin’
about out thar? that old hog is in the gardin’
ag’in, a-h’istin’ the parsnips, and crunchin’ ’em
like an old b’ar.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Consarn her spotted hide!” he vociferated,
jumping up and grabbing a huge cudgel that
lay near by. “Jest you stop yer, stranger, for
about ten seconds, until I make that old swine
think thar’s a trip-hammer got a foul of her,
then I’ll tell ye how the parson got even.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I couldn’t stop to hear the story any way,” I
replied, “for I must be travelling. However,
I’ll take your advice and give the Deacon a
wide berth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As I descended the hill, the swine’s wail was
ringing in my ears, and I judged the trip-hammer
was at work.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE COBBLER’S END.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>A large crowd of people was standing in
and around a small shoemaker’s shop on
Third Street. Elbowing my way to the inner
circle, I found the excitement was over a man
who had committed suicide. He was lying
upon the floor, his hands still grasping a shot
gun, with which he had blown off the top of his
head.</p>

<p class='c006'>I learned it was the shoemaker, and that he
had committed the rash act because the lady on
whom his affections were set had seen fit to
choose another for her partner. Worst of all,
it was a tailor who, to use a common expression
and one to the point, had cut him out. They
were both charmed with the comeliness of the
young woman, and whenever an opportunity
offered, were in the habit of throwing sheep’s
eyes in the direction of her apartment. The
lady seemed to grow more interested in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>situation, and even went so far as to smile archly
upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tailor, who had never received such a
compliment from so pretty a woman before, was
quite carried away with joy. He felt that his
love was returned, and from that moment the
world presented a different aspect. It was not
even a new picture in an old frame, or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vice versâ</span></i>,
but was new throughout.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even the old breeches on his lap seemed to
suddenly undergo a strange metamorphosis.
The stout, rough material, over which he had
lately been bending with crippled fingers and
sprung needle, in the twinkling of an eye seemed
transformed into a golden fleece, through which
the waxed thread flew like chain-lightning
through a cotton umbrella. To have an interview
was now his only study, and where there’s
a will there’s a way.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day a small boy was pressed into service
and intrusted with a letter to the woman in
whom his whole heart seemed wrapped. She
received it safely, and duly by return of post
broke the delightful intelligence to the tailor that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>his love was returned, and ended the epistle by
requesting him to call.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hardly had “seeling night scarfed up the tender
eye of pitiful day,” when the tailor with palpitating
heart ascended the rickety stairs that
led to the apartment. How he was received
there is no knowing, but it is apparent to all
he soon ingratiated himself with the handsome
damsel, as the sequel shows.</p>

<p class='c006'>The knight of the thimble and needle had
saved considerable money and was comely to
look upon, while she was both free and willing
to wed, so the courtship was a short one.</p>

<p class='c006'>As it happened, the tailor had received an
offer from a business firm in the country that
day, and as delays were considered dangerous,
they decided to be married at once and start
for their new home. It chanced that neither
the lover nor his fair inamorata were troubled
with enough luggage to require the services of
an express wagon, and it wasn’t long before
their traps were stuffed into sacks and bundles
ready for removal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Talk about striking while the iron is hot: they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>went ahead of the time-honored injunction, and
hammered the iron while it was yet in the furnace.
The bat had hardly found his evening
meal before they were united and received the
congratulations of the officiating clergyman,
and before Hesperus led her starry host down
to the western main the happy pair might have
been seen bending under their respective burdens,
and moving rapidly down the thoroughfare
to catch the first train for the country.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>Crispin soon discovered his handsome bird

cobbler. He couldn’t bear up under the weight,
and having procured a shot-gun, soon ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>SHUFFLING OFF THE MORTAL COIL.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These facts I gleaned from a grocer who
lived near by, and who was acquainted with all
the parties. My mind was so disturbed by the
distressing event, I found it impossible to sleep
for hours after I reached my room. I started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>in to recite a book of Paradise Lost, but it was
no go. I had Michael assaulting Satan with a
shoemaker’s awl instead of with his sword of
celestial temper. I then endeavored to run
over an act in Shakespeare, but met with no
better success. I had Othello blowing his head
off with a shot-gun, instead of stabbing himself
with a knife. Still, the terrible combination of
circumstances culminating in the death of the
poor cobbler crowded upon me in a saddening
train, and much-needed rest came not to my
relief until the following lines were composed
and set to music:—</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE LAST OF HIS RACE.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>While passing through the market this
morning, I saw the old turkey that had
escaped the ravages of Christmas. He is
said to be the sole remnant of the turkey
tribe—living or dead—at present to be found.
Though the door of his coop was open he
seemed to have no desire to escape. Evidently,
like Byron’s “Prisoner of Chillon,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>has been so long an inmate he has become attached
to it, and would rather remain there than
take his chances in the busy world outside.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stood most of the time in the centre of
the coop in a brown study. Once, while I was
looking at him, he attempted to expand the
dilapidated substitute for a tail and assume the
dignity and strut of other days. The effort
was too much for him, and he settled down
again into a dreamy, somnolent state, from
which the crowing of a large Brahma even
failed to arouse him. The poor fellow will
doubtless fall a victim to man’s rapacity on
New Year, for I noticed a fleshy old epicure
regarding him with hungry sinister looks; nay,
more, setting a price upon his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Passing again through the market this afternoon,
I noticed the coop was empty, the
“Prisoner of Chillon” was missing. Who
had purchased him? or what had become of
him? were questions which, however pertinent
they might be, I felt I had no right to
ask, and I didn’t. But the finger of suspicion
points directly at the mouth of that venerable
justice who was setting a price upon its head.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Now that I am rid of my wild-cat mining
stock, my aching teeth and inverted toenails,
“Jim Dudley” turns up again with his
stories and slang.</p>

<p class='c006'>Last night he told about the fast team he once
sported in Indiana, and I wager considerable
that he never drove a horse in his life, except it
was to the pound that the might get half the fine.
But this is the way he spun his yarn:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did the boys tell you about the span I used
to drive down at Grab Corners? No? wal,
that’s queer. I owned a mi’ty fast pair while I
was stoppin’ thar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see I fust had a four-year old hoss, and
used to go buzzin’ through the village like a
streak o’ lightnin’; and when I had jest enough
whiskey aboard to make me feel a leetle reckless,
I used to turn the corners on the two inner
wheels and never make a miss of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>“My ambition was to own a span, though.
Arter a while I bought a young mare from Deacon
Shovelridge. She was the homeliest lookin’
critter, though, you ever sot eyes on. Her tail
was as hairless as a garter snake. She was a
basin-raised colt, and one mornin’ she was
standin’ round whar the boys were makin’ soap,
and while backin’ up to the blaze to git warm,
her tail caught fire, and every spear of hair was
burned off. It never came out agin, nuther.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It made her look pooty bad, but I see the go
was in her, and that was what I was arter.
Durin’ fly time I used to help her out of her
troubles a leetle by fastenin’ a heavy tassel to
the end of her tail, and arter some practice she
could fetch a fly off her ribs or fore shoulder
e’enmost every pop.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I got her pooty reasonable. The Deacon
said he was actewally ashamed to go out with
her, for the boys were allers a-hootin’ arter him.
Besides, the old codger seemed to have a likin’
for me, and allers took my part when others
were runnin’ me down. The mare matched the
young hoss fust rate. Both had hides like rhinoceroses,
which sweat could never get through.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>They might be bilin’ hot inside, but they never
showed any signs of it outwardly.</p>

ferry-boat. I used to make a commotion
among the villagers when I turned out, for I
could pass everythin’ around the Corners;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>and you ought to have seen the fellers a-runnin’
out to hold their hosses by the head when
they see me comin’, and the wimmin a-hollerin’
and tuckin’ up their skirts and scuddin’ arter
their young ‘uns as though a drove of Mexican
cattle were a-comin’ across the bridge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One day an old sport named Abe Drake,
a sort of spreein’ old bachelor, come over thar
from Illinois. He afterwards married a brokin’ winded
old concert singer that used to be
squeakin’ around there, and went to live in
Hulltown. Wal, as I was sayin’, he came over
there and brought a spankin’ fine team along.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They were amazin’ nice-lookin’ critters now,
I can tell you; skins smooth and shiny as seals,
and tails on ’em that actewally trailed in the
dust behind. He allers had plenty of money,
and was continewally takin’ the gals around to
one place or another. He was ginerally considered
the biggest cat on the wood pile. We
never came in contact when we had our teams
out until one day at a picnic in Gawley’s Wood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That straw-headed Kate Rykert was thar.
She was the rollickin’, don’t-care gal of the village,
one of these tree-climbin’, astride-ridin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>critters, but a mi’ty good gal for all that, and
handsome as a new fiddle. She was well up in

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>“It happened I had a sort of weakness that
way myself, and I didn’t like his maneuverin’
any too well now, I kin assure you. He
couldn’t make much out of Kate, though.
She liked fast horses and a splurge, but she
wasn’t one of those gals that would marry an
old pair of breeches jest because there was
greenbacks in the pockets.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, as I was remarkin’, that day while the
picnic was breakin’ up, we all got talkin’ about
a ball that was comin’ off the followin’ week
down at Crow Bend. Abe wanted Kate to go
down thar with him, but she had partly agreed
afore that to go long er me; so to git herself
out of it and me in, she said she would go with
the one who could take her the fastest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘That’s me,’ said Abe, straightenin’ up kind
of proudly, and givin’ his pantaloons a hitch up
at the waistband. ‘I can let you count the
panels along the turnpike a leetle the quickest
of any person around these quarters,’ and he
looked sideways at me to see how I took the
assertion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It’s not allers the hen that does the most
extensive advertizin’ that makes the largest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>deposits,’ said Tom Ruggles, laughin’, as he
sat thar packin’ away his dishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No, Tom,’ said Gus Parks, the millinery
man, who didn’t like Abe any too well, because
he sort o’ smashed an engagement between him
and the schoolmarm; ‘and it’s not allers your
longest-tailed quadrupeds that git over the
ground the fastest, nuther.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal, never mind, boys,’ ses I, jest easy,
that way, ‘the proof of the whiskey is in the
headache arterwards. I reckon I kin kill as
many grasshoppers between here and Grab
Corners as any person that cracks a whip in
these parts.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What! with them thick-skinned critters of
yourn?’ said Abe, p’intin’ his fingers at my
hosses, and laughin’ as though it was mi’ty
funny. It made me feel pooty riley, but I kept
my temper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Supposin’ they hev thick skins,’ I ses,
‘they’re somethin’ like the cheese that goggle-eyed
Peter bought from the peddler, their peculiarity
doesn’t lie in the thickness of their hide
so much as in the mysterious way they have of
movin’ themselves around.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>“‘S’pose you try a race back to the Corner,
then,’ ses one of the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes,’ ses Kate Rykert, clappin’ her hands
and jumpin’ up. ‘I’ll ride back to the Corner
with one of you, and let Tilley Evans go with the
other, and I’ll go to the ball with the one who
gets to the village first.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Agreed,’ ses Abe, ‘and you’ll ride back with
me?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No, I’m heavier than Tilley,’ ses Kate, ‘let
everythin’ be even; toss up for partners back to
the Corner.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“This seemed fair, so we flipped, and I won
Kate. She weighed ten pounds more than
Tilley, but I didn’t care for that, for I knowed if
the worst come to the worst, she was none of
your jumpin’ out kind; she would stick to the
buggy while there was one wheel and the seat
left, and that’s the sort of a gal to have along
with a feller when he’s tryin’ hoss flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The whole picnic gathered around us when
we were gettin’ our teams ready and war speculatin’
on the result. Money was gwine up on
all sides. Parson Briarly had no change about
him, but he bet his gold-bowed spectacles against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>old Silverthorn’s meerschaum pipe that I would
git to the Corner fust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Beat him, Jim,’ ses Gus Parks, ‘and I’ll
give Kate the best bonnet in the store.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘And I’ll give her the highest-heeled pair of
boots that I’ve got in my shop,’ said Tom Ruggles,
the boot and shoe dealer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then Kate is a bonnet and a pair of boots
ahead, for sartain,’ says I, jumpin’ into the buggy
and squarin’ round my horses for the road; and
with that we started, lick-a-te-split! down the
turnpike, Abe a leetle ahead, but not enough
to make much difference with five miles of
good turnpike ahead of us, without let or
hindrance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pooty soon Kate leaned over to me, and ses
she, ‘You must beat him, Jim, for between you
and me, I would ruther go to the ball with you
than with Abe.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“This made me feel mi’ty good, and ses I,
‘You mustn’t get skeered, then, for I reckon
we’ll hev to take some desperate chances to git
thar fust.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Let me alone for that,’ ses she; ‘when I
can’t ride as fast as a hoss can run, then I’ll stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>to hum, and let dad tote me around in the
wheelbarrow.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just then we came up with him. He tried
to shake us off, and would spurt ahead, but I’d
crawl up on him agin, and stick thar, lappin’
him and goin’ with him stretch for stretch, like
a dog when he’s a-freezin’ to a pig’s ear. Away
went Kate’s hat a-flutterin’ over butter-cup
swale, like a Bird of Paradise over the gardin’
of Eden.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘That’s mi’ty bad, Kate,’ ses I, lookin’ over
my shoulder at it sailin’ off.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Let it go hatchin’,’ ses Kate, laughin’. ‘It’s
only gettin’ out of the way of the new bonnet.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought ’twas a good omen myself, but
didn’t say anythin’, for jist then Abe shot a leetle
ahead, and as he was gwine off, he hollered,
‘You can’t do it, Jim.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I kin,’ ses I, determinedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Your hosses are ginnin’ out; they hain’t
got the bottom into ’em,’ he shouted, jest that
way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It must hev dropped out last night, then,’
ses I, and with that I overhauled him agin.
Past Brian O’Laughlan’s door yard we went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>like a whirlwind through a flour ‘mill, over a
hen and three suckin’ pigs. The old woman
was standin’ thar in the yard with her apron
full of chickens, shakin’ her fist at us and
swearin’ like a drunken gypsy. Her long
tongue was a-slushin’ and dashin’ against her
one front tooth like a mop ag’inst a table leg.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>“I could have laughed myself to tears only
I had to keep my eyes clear, for the road was
so narrow in some places that when we were
abreast there wasn’t any ground to spare.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>JUST AS IT WAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We were now passin’ the half-way spring
and the race was fully as undecided as when we
broke away from the hootin’ crowd on the picnic
grounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Down past old Deacon Shovelridge’s ten-acre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>hop yard we went rack-a-te-bang! hub end
against hub end, and the outer wheels a-spokin’
it within six inches of a four-foot ditch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The ride to the Corners began to look like
the ride to etarnity, and Tilley was as pale as
a gray nun’s ghost, and continewally making
narvous reaches for the lines.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Kate was equal to the surroundin’s.
Thar she sot, with one arm around me and
’tother graspin’ the seat rail, and above the
clatter of hoofs and steel axles, I could hear
her repeatin’:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Stick to him, Jim, and start my stitches, if
he doesn’t git his crop full of dust yet!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old Shovelridge was in the field on a load
of hay as we were passin’. He was inclined
to piety, and if the world had no hosses in it I
reckon he’d have been as pious as a church
organ.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And when he saw us a-raspin’ down the
turnpike as though we were ridin’ in a four-hoss
chariot, and saw Kate Rykert’s great
swad of blonde har a-streamin’ out behind, like
the tail of a comet, he couldn’t contain his
feelin’s no how.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>“He gin a rousin’ whoop like a Chilchat
Indian, when he sights a fur hunter. Throwin’
away the pitchfork—which accidentl’y harpooned
the old lady in the back who was rakin’
behind—and jumpin’ from the load, he took
across the field to’ards the turnpike, swingin’
his old straw hat and hollerin’:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Go it, Dudley; go it! Keep the hoss up
with the rat-tail mare, and I’ll bet my farm
you’ll make Grab Corner fust!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“This made me feel pooty good, for the
mare was the one I had some fears about.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you ought to see how it affected Abe;
he commenced to slash his hosses and swar
like an ox teamster when his cart is stuck hub
deep in the mud.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Finally the off-horse broke, and there was
a sort of irregular upheaval among ’em for a
while, as though they war steppin’ on broken
cakes of ice; one would be gwine down while
’tother was a-comin’ up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Abe tried to bring ’em down to their work
agin, and in the meantime I kind of corkscrewed
ahead and swung into the centre of
the road in advance of him. Then I began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>feel somethin’ like a feller what holds the winnin’
cards, and sees the other chaps a-pilin’ up
the coin on their inferior pasteboards. But I
see some young half-breeds a-squattin’ around
on the road about a quarter of a mile ahead,
and knowed at the rate we war travellin’ we’d
be on top of ’em before they’d see us if I didn’t
haul up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I ses to Kate, ‘See them plag’y brats ahead
of us thar! what bed we better do about it?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Run over the centipedes,’ ses she. ‘Abe
ain’t a gwine to slack up for ’em,’ and she
cuddled closer to me so the jolt wouldn’t hist
her out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shouted two or three times, but they were
too busy with their mud pies, I reckon, to take
any notice, and Abe was makin’ no signs of
haulin’ up. I did my best to sheer round ’em,
and kept right on for the Corner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heered ’em scream as we went a-whirlin’
on, but reckon it was more through fright than
injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Abe had lost his grippin’s. He couldn’t
overhaul me ag’in, no how, and I gradually
crawled away from him, if he did his pootiest.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>“The whole village seemed to be out to the
bridge to see what was comin.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“They see the dust risin’ when we were
more’n a mile away, and they allowed the
greatest run-away was a-comin’ down the turnpike
that had happened since Bull Run, and
were out thar speculatin’ as to whose family
was in danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But when they see it was a race, and recognized
me, you ought to see the scatterin’
amongst ’em. You’d think a hull menagery
had broken loose and was comin’ for ’em.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ole Pelvy, the shoemaker, was a-settin’ on
the railin’ of the bridge; but jest as I crossed
it, the crowd hoorayed, and jostled him off. He
hung over the railin’ by one leg, with his body
swayin’ below, and him a-hollerin’ like a good
feller, and signalin’ for help, but the crowd were
so taken up with the race, and were cheerin’
and swingin’ of their hats continewally, that
they never knowed anythin’ about his position.</p>

<p>CURING PEOPLE’S CORNS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Pooty soon his leg slipped over, and then
he went, end over end more’n twenty-five feet,
into the river, and was carried over the falls
before anybody missed him. Arter that people
weren’t troubled so much with corns around
Grab Corner, for though he’s dead now, I’ll say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>it of him, he was the wust shoemaker that ever
shoved an awl into a hide.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I druv up to the hotel, and had jest got
through helpin’ Kate out, when up come Abe,
with his hosses hobblin’ as if they had picked up
a twenty-penny nail in every hoof.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They looked somewhat as if they had bin
swimmin’ in a soap vat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Abe was very much of a man, though, arter
all. His hosses I reckon had never bin passed
before, but he didn’t bluster or git mad about it
neither, though it must have bin pooty tryin’ to
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘By the Witch of Endor’s long eye tooth,’
he cried, as he jumped from the buggy, ‘you did
it, Jim; and you did it fair. Only I kinder
think you swung in ahead of me a leetle too
quick, back thar where that crazy old whipperin
hollered so.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No, Abe,’ ses I, ‘I didn’t take an inch o’
turnpike till I was entitled to it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wal,’ ses he, as he came round to look at
my animals, that were standin’ thar seemingly
as cool as a brace of toads in a celler, ‘I’ll be
shot if them hosses of yourn ain’t somethin’ like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>the widder Tappan’s boarders. The speed
they show in gettin’ away with anythin’ was
most surprisin’.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“So Kate Rykert got the bonnet and boots,
and I gin her a new dress to go with them, and
if we didn’t shine out some the next week down
to Crow Bend then thar ain’t no use talkin’
about it, that’s all.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DINING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Taking dinner to-day in a restaurant, I was
in danger of being carried off by cockroaches.
If I was inclined to draw comparisons,
I would say that in size the cockroaches I encountered
in this place would compare favorably
with cupboard door buttons. I had seen these
troublesome insects on former occasions when
I thought they were numerous—when they were
as thick around the bread-plate as bees around
their hive in June. But I had never been present
when they turned out in sufficient numbers
to take and hold possession of everything upon
the table, even to the mustard-pot. To-day I
witnessed such a spectacle. I counted until I
tired; their skelping to and fro made the task
painfully difficult, and the effort was abandoned.
They had evidently been lying in ambush in the
cruet stand from the moment I sat down and
gave my order, for the ring of the plate as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>struck the board seemed to be the signal for a
general advance. They appeared in military
ranks, moving towards the dish in a semicircle,
like a line of Fenian skirmishers advancing heroically
upon a turnip patch. There were no
frost-nipped fellows, with drooping horns and
dragging limbs, among those legions either. All
were active, square-shouldered customers, real
thoroughbreds, wide across the hips, and boasting
a depth of chest capable of enduring any
amount of running; while their long, formidable-looking
feelers stood out at right
angles from their heads, like the horns on a
Mexican steer.</p>

<p>BUMMERS ON THE RAID.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>“During your natural life,” I commenced, addressing
a waiter who stood near by, evidently
enjoying my surprise, “whether while officiating
as head steward on board of a floating palace
on the Mississippi, or serving as second cook
on a grain scow on the San Joaquin, did you
ever run across a place where the cockroaches
were one-ninetieth part as numerous as they
are in this restaurant?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Numerous?” he answered; “you should
be here a warm, sunshiny day, if you want to
see cockroaches, for then all the invalids are
out—those fellows who have had their movements
across the table accelerated by a snapping
finger, or such as have only tasted the
poison scattered around for their benefit, or
those who have taken an overdose and throwed
it up again. These lie in cracks and cupboards,
with stiffened joints and weak stomachs,
when the weather is cold and cloudy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>but when a warm day comes, they are all
abroad and busy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I will bear that in mind,” I said, rising
from the table, “and when the next total eclipse
of the sun occurs, which, as I am informed, will
take place in about four hundred and thirty-seven
years, I may come into this restaurant
for another meal, and not until then,” and with
that I left.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The editor of a city paper having occasion
to take a trip into the country, prevailed
upon me to assume the responsibility of answering
letters from correspondents. The
task is an onerous one—the more so as the
editor, with that cunning ever noticeable in a
person who takes the cream of a job, left me
to reply only to the knottiest epistles. But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>will some time get even with him, however. I
will assume the editorial “we,” and should I
waken the wrath of any person, <em>he</em> will be the
sufferer. Here is a copy of my answer to
“Katie:”—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The minister was perfectly right in refusing
to marry the couple, if, as you say, the bride
insisted upon holding her poodle in her arms
during the ceremony. The more so as the
clergyman was near-sighted. He might possibly
mistake the puppy for the bridegroom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Another person accuses a correspondent of
a mis-statement. He says it was the editor of
the <cite>Farmer</cite>, and not the editor of the <cite>Examiner</cite>,
who planted the package of No. 16 homœopathic
pills sent him from the country by a wag,
as the seeds of a Sandwich Island cabbage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old editor for weeks regularly watered
the plot where he sowed them; but as nothing

<p class='c006'>“Amy” is all in a fluster about spirits. I
will talk to her after this manner:—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>“We have always considered spiritualism the
bluest carbuncle that ever festered upon the
neck of society. We care not if the spirits
were rapping around our table like a forty-stamp
mill, we would eat our regular allowance
with all the coolness that a Celestial manifests
when absorbing his birds’-nest soup. If your bed
dances a <em>pas-seul</em> after you get into it at night,
there must be more than spirits around; and
you would do well to throw a boot-jack or flat-iron
under it before retiring. Such a proceeding
might give you the satisfaction of hearing
the spirits yell blue murder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is not much danger of your going
crazy, because, in plain terms, we consider you
to be luny already. The poor fellow in the
lunatic asylum who imagines Queen Victoria
has made a private residence of his nose, and
who has nearly blown both eyes out striving to
eject her, is hardly more so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I trust the editor will lose some hair over that
answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>On second thought, I remember the editor
has none.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>COURT-ROOM SCENES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I am as full of law this evening as a sea-shell of
sound, having been wedged in the District
Court room from 10 o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> to 9 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>,
listening to testimony in the re-trial of the case
of the People vs. a fiery lady, if we may use
the expression, who brought down her game
the first shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though the room was crowded almost to suffocation,
I fancy there is not that deep interest
that was manifested during the former trial.
On that occasion there were so many letters
introduced in evidence, such a mass of private
correspondence dragged from musty trunks,
and laid open to the public, that thousands
flocked daily to the court room, in hopes of
hearing something rich, if not instructive. I shall
never forget the excitement during the reading
of letter No. 947. It was from the defendant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The counsel for the defence argued a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>round two hours and a half by the court-room
clock, against the letter being admitted in evidence.
He maintained it was irrelevant, as it
had never been opened, the receiver forgetting
to read it, or neglecting to do so, for some
reason of his own.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p490.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>A DROWSY JURY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The counsel for the people followed with
even a longer appeal to the judge to admit the
letter, strengthening his argument by lengthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>quotations from Blackstone, Kent, Wharton,
and other authorities, endeavoring to prove
it should be put in evidence, as its contents
might assist materially in furthering the ends of
justice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The judge began to show unmistakable signs
of impatience. He remarked that already a
package of letters had been read that would go
far towards shingling the Mechanics’ Pavilion,
and had no more bearing upon the point at
issue than “Darwin’s Descent of Man” had
upon the culture of white beans. He finally
gave way before the preponderance of the
prosecuting attorney’s argument, and directed
an officer to wake the jury, as a letter was to
be read that all should hear. After considerable
shaking and poking, this difficult duty was
performed. Even the deaf juror was aroused,
though the good-natured judge had permitted
him to sleep during the introduction of several
preceding epistles.</p>

<p class='c006'>After order was restored, and an inventive
juror had improvised an ear trumpet with a
piece of legal cap for his unfortunate companion,
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet doux</span></i> was opened. As the seal was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>broken, judge and jury rose to their feet with
one accord, and leaned as far forward as their
desks would allow, the more readily to catch
every word of the important document. The
silence in the room was death-like. It was supposed
that on the contents of this letter hung
either a scaffold or an acquittal. The weak ticking
of the dusty clock upon the wall was the
only sound that disturbed the awful stillness.
As the calm settled, the muffled beat of the
time-piece increased in force and volume until
it seemed to attain the tones of a fire bell.
Presently the attorney in a high and tremulous
voice began to read. The contents ran thus:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear, Delightful Darling</span>:—How are my
stocks selling now?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your Loving, Adoring L——.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The effect was thrilling. The lawyer dropped
the letter upon the table before him, ran his white
fingers through his hair, and looked around
with the air of a tired traveler when he ascertains
he has walked five miles upon the wrong
road. The gentlemen of the jury, with looks
more of anger than of sorrow, dropped into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>their seats as suddenly as though an invisible
hand had caught them from behind and jerked
them to their benches.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Judge, with an ill-concealed look of disgust,
settled back into his chair, and the deep
crease in his vest, immediately over where his
dinner should have been hours before, grew
more painfully perceptible.</p>

<p class='c006'>I elbowed my way from the suffocating room
before further correspondence was selected from
the package for perusal.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE ANNIVERSARY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>This is the anniversary of my departure
from my native fields. As I sit gazing
by the fire, pondering over the event, thoughts
of friends far away and foes who are near,
come crowding upon me numerous as spirits
around some favored medium.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many years ago I turned my back upon all I
loved and setting my face against the sinking
sun, cried:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ho, sailors! spread your widest sails,</div>
      <div class='line'>And court the strong impellent gales,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until the stout and stubborn mast</div>
      <div class='line'>Bends like a sapling to the blast;</div>
      <div class='line'>And westward let your bearing be;</div>
      <div class='line'>My fortune lies beyond the sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What a ruinous rent fifteen or twenty years
make in a person’s lease of life. Why, bless
my benighted understanding! the seal, the signature
and the better portion of the parchment
are gone. There’s hardly enough document
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>remaining upon which to hinge a hope. Now,
that I think of it, what have the departed years
neglected to bring me? No flaxen heads
cluster around my board; no nose is flattened
against the window pane; no eye strained to
mark my coming, when the granite pave is
chafed by the homeward hastening feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>No jute or mohair chignons lie around my
room in rich profusion, adding charms to the
apartment that pictures cannot give.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I muse upon the many blessings that
the past years have failed to furnish, I am inclined
to sadness. But when I turn to contemplate
what they <em>have</em> brought, my heart sinks
down into its lowest recess and for a time lies
still. Aye! that’s the rub that makes me
wince.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is but little satisfaction in the thought
that I am not alone in this. I look around and
I see others drifting down the stream as rapidly
as I. Time is cutting furrows in fairer brows
than mine. He has brought many a person
during the last ten years—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A scattered sight, a limping gait,</div>
      <div class='line'>Toothless gums and a shining pate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>Why should I squeal because I feel his hands?
But where are those full cheeks, those hopeful
smiles, those luxuriant locks, and firm-set grinders
that once were mine?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gone, like the life from a busted balloon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gone, like the soul from a ruptured bassoon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gone, like the sheen from a pock-pitted cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gone, like our change at the close of the week,</div>
      <div class='line in42'>Gone!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But what has that to do with my sore heel,
peeled to-day by the hoof of a clergyman’s
horse before I could get out of the way? The
event called forth the following lines, written
while laboring under great mental excitement:</p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

  <h2 class='c004'>A COUNTRY TOUR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Yesterday I took a trip to a quiet country
resort. On entering the town I was
surprised at the scarcity of men in the place.
There were plenty of women—fashionably
dressed and otherwise—to be seen in the
houses or gardens, but I rarely encountered
one of the male sex in my travels through the
streets. This, I at first supposed, was owing to
the number of gentlemen residing there who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>carry on business in the city by the sea, and
are consequently in the latter place during the
day. I was informed, however, by the proprietor
of the hotel at which I stopped, that such
was not the case. He assured me it was
mainly owing to the fact that the County Court
commenced that morning, and most of the male
inhabitants, as was their custom on such occasions,
had taken to the surrounding woods and
mountains to escape jury duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The place is beautifully situated between high
green hills, and said to possess the healthiest
climate of any town in the State. During the
summer months people flock there from all
parts of the country. Healthy people pay
high prices at the hotels for the privilege of
living there, and sickly people do likewise, for
the privilege of dying there.</p>

<p class='c006'>The peculiarities of the town, and the distinctive
manners and customs of the inhabitants,
have been ably described by a poet
whose effusions have not yet been translated
into the foreign languages. Following is a
part of the poem which bears directly on the
town in question:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>“Here rest we now by sulphur well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where invalids and nurses dwell;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where yelping dogs run through the street</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like wolves across a prairie wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cattle wild as bison meet</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You face to face, on every side;</div>
      <div class='line'>With tails in air, and frothy nose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leveled horns, they round you close.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where people sit around the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>In lazy groups of three or four,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still their chronic thirst abate</div>
      <div class='line'>With copious draughts of ‘sulphur straight.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was quite an excitement in the town
before I left. A fire broke out in an ash barrel
situated in the rear yard of the house at which
I was stopping, and for a time threatened to
destroy the ashes. There is no estimating the
amount of damage the citizens might have suffered
if the fire had spread to a wash-tub that
stood close by, and which at the time contained
a portion of the town’s washing. Business was
generally suspended, and stock in the insurance
companies went down immediately. The citizens
breathed more freely, however, when the
efficient and energetic Fire Department turned
out promptly as one man, and hastened to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>city water-works, situated on a slight eminence
in the centre of the town, and, turning on the
water, succeeded in extinguishing the flames.
The only damage done was the partial burning
of the barrel and the scorching of the wash-tub
and five dog-houses. The dogs were lying under
the kitchen stove at the time, and escaped injury.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A TRIP ACROSS THE BAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I took a trip across the water this afternoon.
The bay was so rough the ferry-boat
could scarcely make her trips. The passengers
were nearly all sea-sick, and, elbow to elbow,
leaned over the side of the vessel. One gentleman,
while gazing into the sea, lost his hat
overboard, but he was so taken up with internal
affairs that he cared little for outward appearances,
as one could readily observe.</p>

<p class='c006'>I reached my destination, and was convinced
that all the sorrows are not on the sea. I saw
a poor old woman thrown into terrible disorder
by a kick from the cow she was milking in her
own yard. Judging by the quantity of milk
lying around loose, she must have been nearly
through her task, and was probably in the very
act of complimenting the cow for her generosity,
when the spiteful animal gave the pail a hoist
completely over the woman’s head, like a huge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>helmet, while the lacteal fluid ran down her
body. The pail seemed to stick, despite her
efforts to remove it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>PEERING INTO THE DEPTHS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As I looked back, I could see her groping toward
the house, her visage still concealed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>blue bucket. She did look odd enough, as she
felt her way up the steps, decorated with that
novel head-dress.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p509.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>GOOD-BYE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is a youth in this suburban town who
bids fair to be a second Landseer. As I passed
his father’s residence, I saw the young aspirant
at work sketching from nature.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>He had the foot of a little cur fast in the
jaws of a steel-trap staked in the orchard.
The artist sat at a short distance sketching the
poor beast, as it stood on three legs gazing
at the heavens and crying piteously. He
was eagerly striving to get the expression of
pain upon the dog’s face, and by the grin
upon his own countenance I judged he was
succeeding.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p510.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SKETCHING FROM NATURE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was something in the pair that reminded
me of Parrhasius and the Captive; and
being in somewhat of a sketching mood myself
at the time, I produced my book and pencil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>and leaning over the fence, sketched the
painter and his howling model.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p511.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SO SICK!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On my way back to the city the bay seemed
even rougher than in the morning. There was
hardly a passenger on board the ferry-boat but
showed symptoms of trouble. Although most
of them would have been excellent subjects for
the artist of a comic pictorial, my attention was
specially directed towards an elderly lady who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>sat with folded arms, the elbows resting upon
her knees, and a most woe-begone expression
upon her wrinkled visage. Some passengers
who were sick were able partly to conceal their
emotions; <em>she</em> was not; every muscle of her
face betrayed her. She was sick and couldn’t
help but show it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p512.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>AT THE RAIL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>If any individual amongst that crowd of disquieted
passengers knocked louder at the door
of human sympathy than did the old lady referred
to, it was unmistakably that woman who
was sick and had to show it at the vessel’s rail.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHRISTMAS EVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Christmas Eve! I sit idly by my window,
listening to the rapid patter of the
rain upon the shingles and the wild whistle of
the wind as it plays around the gables, or draws
weird music from the telegraph wires stretched
between the house tops, and upon which dangles
the ghost of many a schoolboy’s kite. Christmas
Eve! and I am not yet invited out to dinner!
what can this mean? Am I then left to
wither for want of attention, like some poor
shrub plucked from a garden and planted in a
graveyard? Well, let it be so. Alone though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>I am, I nevertheless enjoy myself hugely, and it
requires considerable to enliven me now. There
was a time when I could be moved to mirth by
very little. The desperate efforts of a one-legged
grasshopper describing circles while endeavoring
to leap straight ahead, would amuse
me for hours together. But it is not so now; I
turn from such scenes to bury my eyes in the
pages of profound works, and it is meet and
proper I should.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the last half hour I have been watching
an old washerwoman stealing, as I think, a
neighbor’s wood. It is barely possible that she
is taking this method of paying herself for services
rendered at the tub. Be this as it may,
the wood is going. There is no mistake about
that.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is interesting to me, as it furnishes food for
comment, and keeps the mind from lagging too
long around the saddening fact that Time is
writing lines upon my brow “with his antique
pen.” Besides it is holiday season, and though
I am not able to be charitable to a great degree,
I can at least afford to be indifferent in
this case.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>The washerwoman is doubtless a hard-working
and deserving old body, who perhaps has
sunk her whole week’s earnings in a Christmas
turkey, that her children’s hearts may be made
glad and their stomachs full; and it would be a
great pity if it should be spoiled i’ the cooking
for the want of fuel.</p>

<p class='c006'>I waive the crime, and speak of the facts from
a disinterested stand-point. I have been such a
diligent scholar in the severe school of experience,
that I have learned to look upon my own
misfortunes lightly, and certainly can behold—with
an unmoistened eye—my neighbor’s
choicest sticks noiselessly slipping into an adjoining
yard. Besides, my neighbor can afford
to lose a few. To make my position good, I
entrench myself behind the following fact: To
be in the fashion, he pays the price of a good-sized
farm for seats at the opera, where the
language is as foreign to his understanding as
South Sea Island gibberish. While he indifferently
beholds such a wasteful running at the
bung, why should I assume the busybody’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>
and clap my finger on the dripping spigot?</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, I saw his wife last evening with fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>four yards of expensive satin trailing in the
dust. It was my misfortune to be walking
directly behind her. As the crowd was pressing
me onward, I was obliged to dance a sailor’s
hornpipe around the hall, in order to keep from
treading upon her skirts. It needed not the
grins of lookers-on to assure me that I was
cutting a ridiculous figure.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am now enjoying my revenge! Indirectly
though it comes, it is none the less sweet or
acceptable. On the contrary, it is rather more
gratifying, as it calls for no action on my part,
but simply to keep my mouth hermetically
sealed. The poet truly sings:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Time at last sets all things even.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It has been in this case much quicker than I
expected. As the skinny white arm stretches
up out of the gloom of the washerwoman’s
yard, and another billet shoots from the pile
and disappears like a star from the firmament
of heaven, I feel that a load is lifted from my
heart, and I am reaping revenge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stay! what is this? a note, that all the evening
escaped my notice. Lo! an aroma issues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>from it, sweet as Cytherea’s breath! It is an
invitation, as I live, to help dissect a Christmas
turkey! Sound the timbrel, beat the tom-tom.
I am not forgotten yet!</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
